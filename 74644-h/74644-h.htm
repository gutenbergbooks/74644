CHAPTER I
<br><br>
"MAN MADE THE TOWN"
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's this dull town to me?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robin's not near.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was't I wished to see?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What wished to hear?<br>
  Where's all the joy and mirth made this town a Heav'n on earth?<br>
  Oh, they are all fled with thee, Robin Adair!"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;SCOTS SONG.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"There!  I told you what kind of a young
man he was, Joan."
</p>

<p>
I only groaned; my elbows on the breakfast-table
and my head buried in my hands.  What
does it matter what "kind" of young man he is, when
you're in love with him?
</p>

<p>
"He's a beauty," declared my chum Elizabeth.  She
pushed back the letter which had come as such a
knockout to me.  "Who's this 'Muriel' who writes to tell
you that she's just seen Harry Markham off to Salonika,
when you didn't even know he'd got his orders?"
</p>

<p>
"It's Muriel Elvey; I introduced him to her myself at
the theatre about a fortnight ago," I explained,
stunned.  "That very pretty girl who was at school
in Germany with me.  I didn't know they'd met again....
He didn't say good-bye to me! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Rotter," snorted Elizabeth boyishly.
</p>

<p>
But some of us would rather be happy with a charming
"rotter" than be bored for life by one of those
prigs who never do anything wrong.
</p>

<p>
Haggardly I stared at that letter with its
gold-printed "Muriel" at the top, its whiff of Chaminade.
Little Elizabeth scowled sympathetically.  She always
had had a grimace for the name of Captain Harry
Markham, who had been my idol for the last year.
</p>

<p>
(A rotter!  What difference does that make!)
</p>

<p>
For that year life was a whirl of thrills and pangs
because of one young soldier-man's black eyes and red
tabs.  At first it was all thrill.  That's bound to be
when the Harry-type&mdash;a born fighter and philanderer&mdash;leader
of men and misleader of women&mdash;fills up a
girl's horizon with his telephone-calls, his invitations,
his flatteries&mdash;and himself.
</p>

<p>
Feverishly happy, I blessed the job that kept me
where he was.
</p>

<p>
(And now this!  This!)
</p>

<p>
My job was one of those that are described as "thundering
good for a girl."  It brought me in nearly three
pounds a week, for I was secretary to a quite important
official in one of those big rabbit-warren buildings in
Whitehall that we call Ministries.  It kept me indoors
from ten A.M. until half-past six or seven or&mdash;if we'd
a rush of work&mdash;eight o'clock at night.
</p>

<p>
It kept nerve and brain on the stretch, too!  My
chief insisted upon taking the last ounce out of his
under-strappers.  Also, he had a horrible temper.  But
I accepted that as cheerfully as I accepted the stuffiness
of that rabbit-warren, and the rushed lunches, and the
work that was draining all the go-stuff out of me.
</p>

<p>
You see, my people lived in the country, and&mdash;because
of Harry&mdash;I simply had to live in town.  It
would have killed me, I thought, to tear myself away
from London and from our flat near Golder's Green.
This had been let, furnished, by an officer, now at the
front, to me and my old school-chum, Elizabeth Weare,
who was clerk at my rabbit-warren.  We did our own
housework and marketing and cooking, tired as we were,
after our office-day was done.  Sounds rather like all
work and no play?  But it wasn't.
</p>

<p>
There was play, to take it out of me more than work.
Play turned my days into a succession of wild jumps
across stepping-stones.  The stones, of course, were
the times when Harry took me out.  I would have
worked underground and consented never to see the light
of day, provided that I still saw him.  Ah, I'm not the
first girl who has made Paradise out of bricks and
mortar, just because they hold a Harry!
</p>

<p>
I thought I was growing to mean to him as much as
he meant to me.  Elizabeth did warn me, but who ever
takes any notice of these warnings from the looker-on
who sees the game?  And Elizabeth was by way of
being a Man-Hater anyhow, so how put any trust in
her opinion of my Prince Charming?
</p>

<p>
Gradually there slipped through the thrill of it all
the first pang of doubt.  Surely he meant to propose?
No?  Yes?  No?
</p>

<p>
The pangs came oftener.  Could he mean nothing?
Just the flirtation that camouflages itself under the
name of being great pals?  Or would he presently say
something?  This was a wearing time, I can tell you.
Presently the thrills grew fewer, the pangs more
frequent.  This is also bound to be when the Harry-type
cools off again.  Was he cooling?  Wasn't he?  A
see-saw of agony!
</p>

<p>
Slowly zest and colour began to fade out of the life
that saw less and less of the young staff officer whose
fancy I had amused for some months.
</p>

<p>
Hope dies hard.
</p>

<p>
Then a whole fortnight&mdash;this last one&mdash;went by
without a sign from him.  I hoped on, wildly, that
something would happen, and, finally, this very morning,
something had happened with a vengeance!  It had
killed hope with a sledge-hammer.
</p>

<p>
Devastating news came from that girl to whom I'd
introduced him myself!  I might have known that
Harry the Susceptible would fall to Muriel's lovely
little Lily-Elsie-like face!  At that German school
they had all raved about it, I remember; walking down
Unter den Linden, Muriel had always been put between
the two severest governesses, and even so the
tightly-uniformed Prussian officers had followed and had
jostled us in passing to try to steal one glance from
"<i>die bild-h√ºbsche Engl√§nderin's</i>" demure big eyes.
</p>

<p>
So those eyes had been the last into which Harry
had smiled before he left Blighty again!  I had never
had another look; I who adored him, who had been given
to suppose that he returned it.
</p>

<p>
Harry had gone.  Gone!  Without a good-bye.
Well&mdash;it was all over&mdash;finished&mdash;na poo!
</p>

<p>
I was left to make what I could of the situation.
</p>

<p>
What could I do?
</p>

<p>
Apparently nothing but gulp down my sugarless tea,
push aside the stale war-bread with its one scrape of
margarine that represented my breakfast, and set off
for my day's work, leaving Elizabeth to wash up.  She
had a day off from the rabbit-warren.  I wished I had;
I scarcely felt like coping with the office.
</p>

<p>
"Poor old kid!  Such is men," grunted Elizabeth.
"You look absolutely played out."
</p>

<p>
"Do I?  I needn't ever bother again about how I
look.  That's one comfort," I sighed, as I crammed on
my hat.
</p>

<p>
This had an impertinent little wreath of coloured
buds, and was lined with rose, because Harry said pink
next to my face always suited me.  I'd bought it to wear
up the river with him.
</p>

<p>
Oh, the pathos of these hats, these pretty frocks that
have been specially bought for "some" man!  Long
after that man has ceased to care a button what one
wears the hat is still fresh, the frock seems to go on and
on.  Things remain.  It's the people who change.  I
must have changed, too, after a blow in the face like
that!  What had it done to me?  I gave one deliberate
and searching glance at myself in the sitting-room
looking-glass.
</p>

<p>
It showed me a plain and weary girl, with ten years
added to her actual age.  A slim, stooping figure that
moved without zest.  Eyes without brightness.  Hair
ditto&mdash;where were "the goldy lights" that Harry once
praised in my hair?  It was as drab and dull as the
whole of my outlook had grown in the last half-hour.
</p>

<p>
I'd had what is called a ripping time, you see.  Here
was the bill I had to pay&mdash;low, secret misery, dark
heaviness of heart, looks and girlishness lost&mdash;as I
thought&mdash;for ever!
</p>

<p>
I stuffed into my bag the fateful letter that had
knocked the bottom out of my world for me.
</p>

<p>
"You're forgetting these," Elizabeth reminded me,
handing me a couple of other envelopes that lay
unopened by my plate.  I hadn't even noticed them.
</p>

<p>
"Haven't time," I said, pocketing them as I dashed
down the four flights of brass-bound steps from our
flat to the entrance.
</p>

<p>
There was no sign that either of those unopened
letters held anything out of the ordinary.  In my
own mind I had no presentiment of wonder to come.  I
thought I knew my fate, thanks.
</p>

<p>
Let this be a lesson to any young woman who thinks
the like.  For when she is quite, quite sure that "all is
over" for her, that is the moment when "All" is
preparing to begin.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Here I've given you my picture as I was all those
weeks ago.  Now skip those weeks and see the contrast;
the picture of me as I am today.  A straight and
supple body, all conscious of the Jest of living.  Limbs
rounded and firm.  Face joyous, glowing, and clean-skinned
under the tan.  Hair glossy and full of gleams;
eyes bright as the morning, with the atmosphere of
sunshine and clean airs all round me.  A new self, in fact,
made by a new life.  Thousands of girls all over the
country at this moment can show the same miracle.
</p>

<p>
I am going to tell you the story of how it happened
to me.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
I had to rush for my Tube train, only in time to be
held up by that exasperating wooden barrier, while the
corncrake voice of the official rasped out: "Stand back,
there!"  And the train did not move out for another
good half-minute.
</p>

<p>
Fuming, I waited on the platform, squashed against
that barrier by the crowd who pressed behind me&mdash;a
crowd who looked nervy and strained, and who&mdash;to
put it mildly&mdash;smelt.  Well, any business girl who
glances at her light blouse after a day's work in town
will know what I mean.  I myself must have looked
about as cheery as that face one sometimes catches
sight of at the small square window of a black
prison-van.
</p>

<p>
The only air and exercise I ever got in those days
were in the three hundred yards' walk from our
Mansions to the Tube, and in the two minutes' scurry at
the other end from the Tube station to the rabbit-warren.
</p>

<p>
I hung on to a strap all the way to Charing Cross,
hating everything.  That letter seemed to have laid
open all my nerves; they were jarred by the jostling
passengers, by the conductor's raucous shouts, by the
very advertisements of patent medicines and boot polish
on the Tube walls, by the steps, the lift, in fact,
everything to do with the loathsome journey.
</p>

<p>
At the office I got a black look from my chief,
Mr. Winter, and a stinging comment on my lateness.  I'd
had them before, but then I'd scarcely noticed them.
Now the daily round seemed unbearable.
</p>

<p>
When I had Harry to look forward to in the evening,
it scarcely mattered how my day was spent.  But
now&mdash;ye gods!  I suddenly found everything rankling&mdash;the
look of the rabbit-warren's dingy corridors and
annexes, the click of the typewriters, the whir of the
telephone bells, and the Cockney accents of some of the
workers!
</p>

<p>
And worst of all was the inevitable office smell, made
up of so many horrors.  I put them in their order of
unpleasantness:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The hot iron of the water pipes.
</p>

<p>
Ink.
</p>

<p>
Dust.
</p>

<p>
Common yellow soap.
</p>

<p>
The sink.
</p>

<p>
Stale office towels.
</p>

<p>
Cigars.
</p>

<p>
All this sounds an unmitigated grouse!  But I have
to get it over, showing you the perfectly revolting time
I had.  Sunlight and sweet air have since streamed
into my days.  But how can I forget the stuffiness
of Mr. Winter's room?
</p>

<p>
"Can't we keep that window shut?" was my chief's
motto.
</p>

<p>
The one extremely grimy window gave on to Whitehall,
and to open even a crack of it let in all the
noise of the traffic.
</p>

<p>
"Can't we have that window kept SHUT?"
</p>

<p>
The last word rang out like the crack of a whip
almost before I got in, on this particular morning.
</p>

<p>
I shut the window and got to work, suddenly wondering,
"Shall I go on like this until I'm eighty?"  My
job for that beastly morning was to check long columns
of figures on blue paper, with a form-number at the top,
from duplicate lists.
</p>

<p>
Thrilling!
</p>

<p>
My eyes swam and my head throbbed as I muttered
to myself over the table: "Nine thousand three hundred
and sixty-five pounds nineteen shillings and a penny.
Nine thousand three hundred and sixty-five pounds
nineteen and a penny.  (Tick off.)  Two thousand
four hundred and ten pounds eleven shillings," and so
on.  The lists almost invariably tallied, but one dared
not risk an error.  "Nine thousand three hundred
and&mdash;&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
What a life!  I saw it now as it was.  That letter
had opened my eyes.  Oh, to get away from it all!
</p>

<p>
At lunch-time I went out, avoiding the chattering
throng of girls.  It was one of those sultry
early-Spring days that seem hotter than July.  All the
luncheon-places were as full up as the Tube had been.
I could not wait for a seat in that atmosphere of
not-too-cheap but nasty food.
</p>

<p>
Eggs that were "fresh in places," badly poached, on
toast limp with water, and never a suspicion of
butter&mdash;fish that had said good-bye to the sea many days
ago; or burnt pieces of bacon swimming in thin fat&mdash;all
these presented unpalatable realities which I felt
absolutely unable to face that day of days.
</p>

<p>
Sickened, I turned back into the glare of Trafalgar
Square.  I sat down listlessly in the only patch of shade
that I could find, on the steps of the National Gallery.
I looked across the bone-dry fountains where wounded
soldiers were swinging their bluer-trousered legs.  I
gazed gloomily past the Nelson Column, down Whitehall,
with its 'buses and people.
</p>

<p>
Ants on a human ant-heap, struggling for life&mdash;but
was it worth living?  Deep in my heart the thought
persisted, "I must get out of this.  I can't stand it.
How can I get away?"
</p>

<p>
Half-consciously my hand went to my bag to feel for
the letter that had blackened existence.  I hadn't
looked at it again since Elizabeth had indignantly
pushed it back to me.  My fingers met the two other
letters, not yet opened.
</p>

<p>
"May as well see what they are," I thought, drearily.
</p>

<p>
One was a rather terrifying bill for shoes.  Well, it
would be the last of its kind&mdash;it's love that comes so
ruinously expensive in nice shoes and stockings!
</p>

<p>
The other was in a clear, strong hand-writing that
I didn't know, and it had been forwarded on from my
home.
</p>

<p>
I opened it.
</p>

<p>
Picture me, a speck of navy-blue and white on the
grey steps.  London glaring and blaring beyond me,
and in my hand the scrap of paper&mdash;the second letter
that was to fall upon me like a thunderbolt.  First,
Muriel's about Harry.  Now this.  I'd been actually
carrying it about with me all the morning unopened,
cheek-by-jowl with that other letter!
</p>

<p>
Listen to it!
</p>

<p>
Except that it was dated from some barracks, I
didn't notice the address.  My eye had at once caught
the first sentence:
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
"My dear Joan,&mdash;They say a woman never forgets
the first man who has kissed her&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Wouldn't those words give any girl a jolt?  They,
startled me, even in my stricken state.  "The first
man who'd ever kissed me"&mdash;but the first and only
man had been Harry himself!  What on earth was
the meaning of this, in a stranger's handwriting?  It
went on:
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
"That is why I have the cheek to write to you.
Now you'll turn to the end of this letter to see who I
am."
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Exactly what I found myself doing, breathlessly!

<p>
The signature of the letter was&mdash;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "Yours,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"RICHARD WYNN."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Now, who in the world might he be?  Richard Wynn?
Wynn?
</p>

<p>
Ah!  Suddenly I realized why the surname at least
was familiar.  Mr. Wynn!  Of course!  I placed him,
now.  I did remember.  Sitting there, wan, on this the
most miserable morning of my life, my thoughts were
switched back just seven years.
</p>

<p>
Seven mortal years ago!  A gap between a
disillusioned young woman of twenty-two and a gawky
eager child of fifteen, as I then was.
</p>

<p>
That had been in the days when we lived on the borders
of Wales.  My father had farmed, in a scrambling
sort of way, the small estate that he owned there, and
as he had to make ends meet somehow, he had taken in a
trio of hobbledehoys as farm pupils&mdash;what they'd
learnt from dear old Dad's antiquated methods
goodness only knows.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wynn was the eldest of these pupils.  I don't
think I'd ever taken as much interest in him as I had in
the fox terrier puppy that he gave me just before he
sailed for the ranch of an uncle in Canada.  But I had
hated his going away.  I always did hate partings, even
from the succession of mountain-bred cooks who stayed
their six months with us.  On that gloomy autumn
morning, with the mountains blotted out by mist and
the rain coming down in a steady drip-drip-drip on the
slate roof, when we had all gathered in the veranda to
say good-bye to the departing pupil I had suddenly felt
like bursting into tears.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wynn, the leggy, dark-haired Welsh lad of nineteen,
had turned with his brand-new suit-case all ready
labelled in his hand, had seen my blank look, had
stared down upon me and had clutched me by the
pig-tail as I turned to flee.
</p>

<p>
"Nice kid, ripping kid," he'd muttered in a brusque,
touched young voice.  "Give us a kiss for good-bye,
Joan."
</p>

<p>
And he'd drawn my head back by its plait and kissed
me under the eyes of my amused family.  They had
ragged me about it for months.  How should I, at that
age, have guessed the difference between that and a real
kiss?  Years later Harry had slipped the real kisses
into my life, in the course of conversation, so to speak,
and by imperceptible degrees, which was Harry's
insidious way of making love&mdash;none the less fatal!
</p>

<p>
Now, on the very day when love had left me in a way
so very far from being imperceptible, here was this
reminder from that other, forgotten young man, that
went on:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Plenty of things have happened since we said good-bye;
but I've often wondered what became of the pretty
kid with the thick brown pigtail.  You'd a blue bow on
it that day, and you never noticed that I walked off
with that.  I suppose there's just an off-chance that
you are not married yet.  Are you?  If you aren't,
would you care to marry me?"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I gasped as I came to this.  Who wouldn't have been
petrified?
</p>

<p>
"Would you care to marry me?"
</p>

<p>
But how&mdash;how fantastic!  At breakfast-time upon
this very day I'd had conveyed to me the devastating
news that the one young man on whom my thoughts had
hung wished to see no more of me.  Now, at midday,
here was shock No. 2.  Another young man, of whom
I hadn't thought since I was grown up, was actually
proposing to me.
</p>

<p>
Both on one day!
</p>

<p>
Was I living in some wild dream of coincidences?
But no.  The Harry-wound went on aching steadily
beyond this flash in the pan even as I read on.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"It sounds mad, I know."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The writer actually admitted it.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I'd explain details and things better if I saw you.
May I come and see you?  If so, please write to me
here, where I shall be for the next ten days.  I could
get over to your father's place.  This needn't commit
you to anything.  But if it is all off, don't write.  If
I don't hear from you within a week I shall know it was
good-bye for good.&mdash;Yours, RICHARD WYNN."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Stupefied, I sat staring at his letter.
</p>

<p>
Now a proposal of marriage from almost any young
man in this world would bring its special thrill to almost
any girl.  This, quite apart from whether she accepts
it or refuses.  Isn't that true, girls?
</p>

<p>
So it shows what a stupor of despair I was in that
morning, when I tell you that only for a fleeting moment
did I forget my troubles in the excitement of this
Mr. Wynn's letter.
</p>

<p>
I sighed as I got up, feeling a little dizzy from my
perch on the National Gallery steps, for St. Martin's
Church clock showed half-past one, and it was time I
started walking slowly back to that revolting office.
I'd had no lunch, but lunch-time would be considered
over by the time I had crawled down Whitehall again.
Heavens!  How I hated Whitehall, and wished that I
never need set eyes upon ...
</p>

<p>
Here the quite wild idea sprang into my mind.
</p>

<p>
"What about this way out of it?  What if this were
what I was longing for, the chance of a completely
new life?  Something to whisk me right away out of
everything that I knew in the days of Harry!  Here's
this Mr. Richard Wynn&mdash;who was quite a nice young
man, if I could only remember his face a little bit more
distinctly&mdash;asking to marry me.  What if I said
'Yes'?  Since I was not to marry Harry, what did
it matter what sort of a man I did marry?  But what
was he like?"
</p>

<p>
Frowning, I tried to remember.  Dark, tall, Norfolk
jacket, loved dogs&mdash;that was as far as I got.  Not a
detail of his face could I recall!  An unawakened
girl-child, as I was seven years ago, takes scant notice of
masculine faces.  All she thinks of them is "How ugly
they are; how very unlike the people in books that the
beautiful ladies are always falling in love with"&mdash;and
that's the summing-up of it for her, until she is seventeen
or so.  (Unless she's of the type of my little chum
Elizabeth, who at twenty-one continued to hold this
view.)
</p>

<p>
But what about this Richard Wynn, who at nineteen
had seemed a century older than I?
</p>

<p>
Nowadays, I should not consider as a grown-up man
that youth who'd devoured such platefuls of cold mutton
and bread and cheese at my father's table.  I wondered
listlessly how he'd grown up.  Quite cold-bloodedly&mdash;for
remember what I was going through&mdash;I began to
debate whether I'd say I would see him.  It might be
better than the office; better than living exactly the
same life day after day, without Harry.  And Harry
would hear if I got engaged.
</p>

<p>
How many engagements, I wonder, are entered into
in the mood in which I was at that darkest of moments?
</p>

<p>
I thought, "If I write&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Then my thoughts were broken into by something
very different.
</p>

<p>
I'd already noticed, while only half-seeing it, that a
little crowd had collected down in Trafalgar Square
about the spot where the Tank Bank stood in the
spring, a crowd composed of Colonial soldiers, of
bare-headed factory girls from Charing Cross Road, of girl
clerks from the countless Government offices round
about.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p17"></a>
Without much interest I glanced over the stone
coping.  Above the heads of the thickening crowd I
saw a banner.  It was white, with the scarlet-lettered
motto:
</p>

<p class="t3 smcap">
"England Must Be Fed."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There was a group on the small raised platform
beneath it, an elderly man in a frock-coat, some ladies,
and the gleam of a light smock.  Some one was speaking
underneath that flag.  In the sultry midday air I
suddenly heard, fresh and clear, a girlish voice.  These
were the scraps that came to me:
</p>

<p>
"I appeal to you girls in this crowd.  Some of you
are country-born girls, like me.  I'm from Wales.  My
county was a green county.  It is now a red
county&mdash;ploughed up to help carry on the war.  But must we
look at these fields full of crops and think, 'These will
rot in the ground because there will never be hands
enough to carry them in'?"
</p>

<p>
Ah!  Land Army!
</p>

<p>
I'd heard of this before, and now Trafalgar Square
saw girls being recruited as, three years ago, it
saw young men being asked why they were not in
khaki.
</p>

<p>
Then the speaker's young voice rose earnestly to
my listless ears:
</p>

<p>
"I have put before you the disadvantages of this life.
Long hours.  Hard work.  Poor pay.  After you get
your board and lodging a shilling a day, perhaps.
Very poor pay.  But, girls&mdash;our boys at the Front
are offering their lives for just that.  Won't you offer
your services for that&mdash;and for them?"
</p>

<p>
The voice attracted me, the Welsh voice that holds
the secret of being clear, yet soft, with the ends of its
words pronounced as crisply as by a well-trained singer.
It held me, that voice, while the speaker touched on the
urgent need of workers to fill the places of men, who had
gone from farm, field, dairy and byre.
</p>

<p>
Ah, the charming picture that she made!  A bright,
sturdy flower of girlhood set against-the parched
stone-work of Town!  She wore the Land Girl's uniform that
sets off a woman's shape as no other costume has done
yet.  Under her slouch-hat her face was vividly brown
and rose-coloured, with dark eyes alight.  Her fresh,
light belted smock, with its green armlet and scarlet
crown, looked cool as well as trim.
</p>

<p>
The sight of her, I thought, should bring in as many
recruits as the speech.  She looked as if she'd never
dreamt of such things as unventilated offices, typewriters
that clicked mechanically all day, nervous headaches,
lives soured and blighted at twenty-two!  Enviously
I glanced at her.  Suddenly&mdash;was it my
imagination?&mdash;she looked straight back at me over the
heads of the crowd.  It was to me she seemed to be
speaking now.
</p>

<p>
"You are offered some good things in this new life,
girls.  Good health.  Good sleep&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Here I smiled bitterly.  Good sleep....  I'd had
a whole fortnight of hideously broken nights.
</p>

<p>
"There's no sleep like that of the worker on the
land!" declared the recruiting land girl.
</p>

<p>
"Another thing you're offered is a good conscience
with which to meet those lads when they return from
fighting for you.  Lastly&mdash;though I don't know if
it's worth mentioning, really"&mdash;here her white teeth
flashed in a merry smile across her rosy face&mdash;"you
are offered a good complexion!"
</p>

<p>
Then something else unexpected happened.  She
jumped lightly down, and it was first of all to
me&mdash;me!&mdash;that she made her way.
</p>

<p>
Straight up to me she came.  She looked me full in
the face, smiled prettily, and in that clear voice that
sounded home-like to me because my home had been
where she, too, came from, she said:
</p>

<p>
"I've been watching you all the time I've been
speaking.  I want to say something to you."
</p>

<p>
"You want to speak to me?" I said, surprised.
</p>

<p>
"I noticed you at once," said the Land Girl.  "You
looked&mdash;well, not very pleased with life."
</p>

<p>
Here a passer-by glanced at the contrast we made
standing there: Government office clerk and Land Girl.
She, in smock and breeches, radiated rosy health; I,
wearing my blue costume, Frenchy blouse, flower-wreathed
hat and Louis-heeled shoes, wilted in limpness
and pallor.
</p>

<p>
She said prettily:
</p>

<p>
"Are you on war-work of any kind?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I am.  I work at&mdash;&mdash;" I gave her the
rabbit-warren's real name.
</p>

<p>
Her bright face fell.
</p>

<p>
"What a pity.  We're told not to try for recruits
who are engaged in other departments.  I was going
to ask you to join up for the Land Army."
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-020"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-020.jpg" alt="&quot;<i>I was going to ask you to join up for the Land Army</i>&quot;">
<br>
&quot;<i>I was going to ask you to join up for the Land Army</i>&quot;
</p>

<p>
"I!  Oh, I should be no earthly good at that sort
of thing," I assured her pettishly, I'm afraid.  "I
must get back to the office."
</p>

<p>
"A pity," remarked the fair recruiter regretfully.
"Perhaps you've a friend who's not so busy.  Would
you pass these on?"
</p>

<p>
I took the leaflets she offered.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye," she said.  Once out of sight of that
energetic young worker, I rolled her papers into a ball
and tossed them into a county council waste-paper bin.
</p>

<p>
That is, I thought I did.
</p>

<p>
My head ached so desperately that I hardly knew
what I was doing by the time I got out of the glare of
Whitehall and into the gloom of the office.
</p>

<p>
I was before Mr. Winter, the chief who disliked me
as much as he disliked open windows.  Here was my
chance to let in an apology for a breath of air.  I
tugged at the window.  It was stiff.  Down it came
at last.  But the effort had been too much for me in
my run-down state; it made me feel positively sick.
</p>

<p>
Then came the last straw.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, unexpectedly, Mr. Winter rasped out behind me:
</p>

<p>
"Can't you keep that window shut?"
</p>

<p>
I jumped violently&mdash;think of the morning I'd had.
I forgot myself.
</p>

<p>
"Don't shout at&mdash;&mdash;" I began.  But all in an instant
the office became dark as night.  I threw out my
hands.  Then I pitched forward on my face, knowing
no more.
</p>

<p>
I had fainted dead away.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Half an hour later I was sent home, after Mr. Winter
had leapt at his chance of telling me that I was
obviously not strong enough for war-work, and that I need
not present myself at these offices any more.  Perhaps
he was scarcely justified.  Perhaps he wanted to
frighten me into an appeal.  But I didn't say a word,
I was too dazed.
</p>

<p>
Sacked!
</p>

<p>
Well, after that, I thought, there was only one thing
for me to do.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br><br>
THE TOSS-UP
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
"And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss."&mdash;KIPLING.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Elizabeth!  What should you say if I were
to accept an offer of marriage?" I demanded
abruptly.
</p>

<p>
This was after I'd got back to the flat, had flung
myself down on my bed with the announcement that I'd
been sacked from the rabbit-warren, and had turned
thirstily to the tea that my chum had brought in at
once.
</p>

<p>
Washed-out, I lay against the pillow, while Elizabeth
did the ministering angel in a boyish shirt, and with
thick black locks "bobbed" about her square-chinned
little face.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth is the most loyal pal who ever barked out
home-truths at a chum, waiting on her hand and foot
the while ... Oh, girl-friends!  What would life be
without them when men forsake us by desertion and
death, when other men overwork us and harry us, and
when all men (as it sometimes seems) misunderstand
us!  Men don't believe in loyal and lasting friendships
between women.  Elizabeth, in return, never believed
much in men.
</p>

<p>
"Offer of marriage?" she retorted.  "What are
you raving about?"
</p>

<p>
Between sips of tea I gave her the story of the letter
that I had taken away unopened that morning.
</p>

<p>
"Asks me to write within the week, unless it was to be
good-bye for good!" I concluded.  "What do you
think of it?"
</p>

<p>
"Shell-shock," Elizabeth promptly suggested.
"Poor fellow!  Must be quite off his head.  How long
was he out at the Front, Joan?"
</p>

<p>
"How should I know?  I only know he wrote from
those barracks."
</p>

<p>
"You don't know his regiment or anything?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a thing.  Not the colour of his eyes, or why
he never wrote to me before, or where he's been for the
last seven years, or what doing.  Absolutely nothing
do I know about him.  Except that he wants me to be
his wife!"
</p>

<p>
My stupor of the morning had given way to a reaction
of bravado; I laughed into Elizabeth's little
steady face.
</p>

<p>
"Knew you weren't serious," she said.  "I'm glad
you're bucking up, though.  It's quite a mercy that
you have got the sack.  You'd have had to go home
and take things easy for a bit in any case, so&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Here I interrupted her with more vigour than I'd felt
capable of all day.
</p>

<p>
"Go home?" I echoed, really nettled.  "D'you
imagine that I'm going home after this?  Not much!
Go home!  Go back to&mdash;&mdash;"  I took a long breath to
underline the words&mdash;"to Agatha?"
</p>

<p>
Now, Agatha was my young stepmother.
</p>

<p>
Nobody could find fault with Agatha.  She was
sensible, quiet, admirably domesticated, a splendid
needlewoman and parish worker, an excellent wife to
Dad, and always tactful towards his grown-up children.
Only&mdash;well, Agatha was a person who never made a
mistake in her life.  And the people who do make headstrong,
passionate, idiotic mistakes&mdash;well, is it to that
sort of person that they turn when they're in trouble?
I ask you.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth shook her cropped head.  She had to see it.
</p>

<p>
"What will you do, then?  Try for another job in
town, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't care what I do!" I said wearily.
"There aren't many things I can do.  Marrying this
young man is one of them, anyway.  Why shouldn't I?
All marriage is a ghastly risk.  Especially when a girl
knows she can never, never care for anybody."
</p>

<p>
It was here that Elizabeth, that good chum, took me
fairly in hand.
</p>

<p>
"I'll talk now," she said.  "You listen."  And she
began to talk coolly and helpfully and like a dose of
bromide, which was what I needed at that point.
</p>

<p>
"You said there weren't many things you could do.
Home's off.  You're not rich enough to do nothing, so
you must do something.  That means you either marry
for a job&mdash;lots of girls do, poor wretches&mdash;or take
one.  I suppose your precious Winter isn't too chilly to
give you a reference?"
</p>

<p>
"I daresay he's warmer now he's got that window
shut!" I answered languidly.
</p>

<p>
"Then you're left with the choice of doing a sensible
thing or a silly one," Elizabeth declared.  "You go
into another Government office, or you marry this man,
who may drink or squint or have a beard for all you
know."
</p>

<p>
"He used not to," I murmured with my eyes closed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you do remember so much about him?  I say,
could I see his letter?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course.  Rummage in my bag for it, will you?&mdash;but
I've told you all that was in it."
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to see the writing," said Elizabeth,
rummaging.  Presently I heard her say "Hullo!" in a
more alert voice.  I opened my eyes interested&mdash;Elizabeth
was scanning a paper.  It was headed:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="t3 smcap">
"Women's Land Army."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I thought I threw those things away," said I.
"Can't you find the letter?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Elizabeth.  "No other letter here."
</p>

<p>
Instantly I realized what I had done.
</p>

<p>
"It was Mr. Wynn's letter that I threw away,"
I exclaimed dismayed.  "Address and all.  I thought
it was those pamphlets.  How silly of me!  Now I
can't write to Mr. Wynn!"
</p>

<p>
"That settles that," said the practical Elizabeth,
"and leaves you to take another Government office
job or&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She paused for emphasis, looked straight at me.
"Or <i>this</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Here she waved the paper she'd been studying.
It showed pictures of smiling girls in smocks
and breeches, busy.  They were making butter, they
were stacking fodder, they were feeding baby calves
out of buckets.  Underneath the photographs was
written:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Will</i> YOU <i>do this</i>?"
</p>

<p>
I stared at Elizabeth.
</p>

<p>
"Join the Land Army!  Me!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you.  Do your bit.  They say England wants
feeding.  It looks like it"&mdash;she glanced at the
comfortless tray&mdash;"so go and help, Joan."
</p>

<p>
"Would you like to, yourself?" I retorted.
</p>

<p>
"Me?" cried Elizabeth in turn.  "Nothing would
induce me, thanks.  I should loathe it!"
</p>

<p>
"Yet you think I ought to join up!"
</p>

<p>
"Best thing for you," declared my chum briskly.
"Help your country, work in the open, get fit, and
forget there are such things as men!"
</p>

<p>
"All very well for you to talk in that gay and airy
way about 'forgetting,'" I retorted, nettled again.
"You wait&mdash;&mdash;!  If ever <i>your</i> time comes&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ha!" jeered Elizabeth, putting back her bonnie
little head of a page, and squaring her shoulders.
"If&mdash;&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
She looked like the Princess of that fairy-tale on
whom the fairies laid a curse that she should never
marry a man she loved because, on her bridal night,
she herself would be turned into a lad.
</p>

<p>
"Stranger things have happened," I threatened her,
"than a girl like you falling in love in the end."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  A girl like you getting over it.  That's
happened before now," retorted the downright little
Man-hater.  "Now, what about this Land Army idea?"
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but I should hate every minute of it!" I
objected.
</p>

<p>
"Worse than marrying the wrong person?" murmured
Elizabeth.
</p>

<p>
Here an odd thing happened.  At those words "the
wrong person" there flashed into my mind for the first
time the thought that has visited it, ah! how often
since then, in spite of Harry, in spite of my not caring
what happened now.  In spite of everything, it struck
me, "If I never hear anything more about this Mr. Wynn,
it will be a pity."  Yes, at the time I felt that.
</p>

<p>
"What a toss-up everything is," I said recklessly.
"Shall I go to work in breeches and a smock?  Or
shall I get married?  Heads or tails?  Have you a
penny, Elizabeth?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't be silly."
</p>

<p>
"I mean it.  Have you a penny?"
</p>

<p>
"Put my last into the gas meter!"
</p>

<p>
"Then I'll try this."  I took up the remaining dry
biscuit from the bread platter.  "England must be
fed," I quoted.  "Heads I go and help to feed her.
Tails I marry for a job.  Heads is the side with the
maker's name on.  Now!"
</p>

<p>
I spun the biscuit into the air.  Gambling with
England's food!
</p>

<p>
It came down, spun on the empty platter, fell flat.
</p>

<p>
With quite a thrill I bent to see the result of my
toss.
</p>

<p>
"Heads!"
</p>

<p>
"Land Army!" cried Elizabeth, throwing up her
head.  "We're for it!"
</p>

<p>
I turned to her.
</p>

<p>
"We?"
</p>

<p>
"Looks like it!  Suppose I've got to join up with
you," grumbled my chum, who was always better than
her word, "and see what comes!"
</p>

<p class="thought">

<p>
A fortnight later we were both glancing at the set of
our new Land Army hats in the narrow strip of mirror
of a railway carriage, bound for the countryside.

CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
THE FIRST NIGHT IN CAMP
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
"Why did I leave my little back-room in Bloomsbury?"&mdash;VICTORIAN SONG.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Transformation scene.
</p>

<p>
From a London office to a Land Girls' Camp
in Mid-Wales.  From a cramped, sixth-story
flat looking down on slums to that big light hut set
among the woods that peeped a green "welcome" in
at the many windows.
</p>

<p>
Every window was wide open on that first evening
when Elizabeth and I got down to the camp.
</p>

<p>
Our first impressions of it?  Well!  I can only say we
were not "out" to be encouraged, or to like anything
at all at that moment!  Tired, stiff from our journey,
awkward in our unfamiliar uniform and heavy boots,
we followed the young forewoman who'd met us at the
tiny station called "Careg," and had piloted us up and
down what seemed interminable miles of lanes to this
hut.
</p>

<p>
A queer, surprisingly ugly place, this long bare
building!  Corrugated iron without, matchboarding
within, with bare floors, trestle tables, and kitchen-chairs.
It had been intended for a parish hall for meetings
and sales of work; but the platform had been
taken away, and the whole building turned into a
barracks for girl-workers.  Land Army slouch hats and
brown raincoats hung from the pegs, gay-coloured
prints were pinned upon the unvarnished walls, and
flowers stood about in glass jam-jars.
</p>

<p>
The place resounded with laughter and talk.  It was
clustered with Camp-ites, who wore the same rig as our
own.  We still felt as if we were in fancy-dress.  But
these other light smocks and laced-up leggings and
hobnailed boots all bore the signs of honest wear and tear
from the work for which they were designed.
</p>

<p>
These girls had "worked themselves and their clothes
in" to the new job.  On that first evening they looked
to us a race apart.  They made me feel a nervous and
apologetic weed!  They were a bewildering crowd.
</p>

<p>
"Now, you girls!  Make a bit of room at this end
of the table," ordered the forewoman cheerily.  "Here
are the two new workers for the training depot.
They're to live here."
</p>

<p>
Faces turned from each side of the long mess-table
towards us.  The babel of talk died down.  There was
a scraping of chairs on the scrubbed floor.  A girl
jumped up and fetched cups; another pushed aside one
of the glass gallipots that held sheaves of blue-bells
and marsh-yellows all down the table.
</p>

<p>
"That's right.  You sit here, will you?  Room for
a little one!"&mdash;the little one being Elizabeth, who
seemed to have shrunk since she put on breeches,
into some small, shock-headed, pale and defensive boy.
"And you, Vic, look after this other one."
</p>

<p>
"What's your name?" from the forewoman.
</p>

<p>
"Matthews?  Joan Matthews!  Sit down, Joan; have
your tea.  There's plenty more milk in the big jug;
and pass up that bit of rhubarb pie for them.  They're
all the way from London."
</p>

<p>
"London!" chorused the girls at the table in a
variety of voices.
</p>

<p>
"London, fancy!"
</p>

<p>
"Eustern!  All change!  Stand clear o' the
gates!" sang out one, in gruff imitation.  "Air-raid
shelter this way!  Full up, full up!  Pass along
there."
</p>

<p>
"Piccadilly, theatres and shops!"
</p>

<p>
"Bond-street!"
</p>

<p>
"'Igh-street!"
</p>

<p>
"Dear old giddy London!"
</p>

<p>
"Bit of a change to Careg Camp, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is," I admitted, and in the breezy laughter
my voice was drowned, also my heartfelt sigh.
</p>

<p>
For a sudden wave of regret swept over the whole
of my tired being.  I wondered what had possessed
me to leave London.  It was going to be awful!  Why
had I been so mad as to fill up those forms which that
girl had given me in Trafalgar Square, and to make
those inquiries, and to attend that Selection Committee
and that Medical Board?
</p>

<p>
Why had I let Elizabeth&mdash;who was looking gloomy
enough on her side of the table&mdash;persuade me to take
this silly step?  Why on earth did I join the Land
Army for twelve months, agreeing to go wherever I was
sent?  Here they'd sent us into the wilds of the
country&mdash;hundreds of miles away from every soul we knew,
into this bare barn of a place and this mob of strange
girls!
</p>

<p>
There!  Now one of them who'd finished tea sprang
up&mdash;sprang as if it were the beginning instead of the
end of a working day&mdash;went to the piano at the other
end of the hall, and began to rattle out gay music;
and then two others were jumping up, too, taking each
other by the hands in a clear space of the room and
swinging into a two-step&mdash;dancing!  After they'd
been working on a farm-course all day!
</p>

<p>
They were all so bursting with "go" and chattering
spirits that I felt I could never cope with them.  Never
should I make friends!  Never should I attain to
anything they could do!  Never accustom myself to the
strangeness of all this!
</p>

<p>
Here I was, a fish out of water.  Even if I were
miserable in London, it's better to be wretched in a
place that you're used to, and where you're not
expected to make any unwonted efforts, or to be
bothered by fresh people.  Yes!  Would to goodness I'd
stuck it in London, instead of rushing out of that
frying-pan into this fire.
</p>

<p>
Absolutely "out of it all" and miserable, I expect
my thoughts showed in my face as I sat there.  For
a bright-eyed girl opposite, with riotous red hair and
a rounded throat starred with freckles, leaned across,
smiled, and remarked in the deep, soft contralto of
Southern Wales:
</p>

<p>
"Sure to feel strange at first!  Longing for home.
I was the first ten days.  Oh, I would have bought
myself out and packed up.  I would, indeed&mdash;&mdash;" she
paused, and turned to the girl sitting beside me.
"But they won't want to get back to town after they've
been here a bit, will they, Vic?"
</p>

<p>
The big dark Land Girl "Vic," who sat next to
me, showed all her white teeth in a large and friendly
grin.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, you'll be all right.  You wait till you've
stopped down here a couple of weeks, Celery-face,
and your own boy won't know you again!" she
assured me in a ringing Cockney accent that set all
the others laughing delightedly.
</p>

<p>
How popular she seemed!  Good-natured, too.
Presently I found her taking Elizabeth and me under
her wing while the other girls went on with their
various occupations.
</p>

<p>
None of them seemed to want to fling herself down
and rest, doing absolutely nothing&mdash;which was all I
should feel fit for, I thought gloomily.  From the
scullery-shed outside the hut came the sound of
clinking crockery and of laughter, as two of the girls
washed up.  Overpoweringly cheery young women!
I thought, peevish with fatigue.
</p>

<p>
Vic's Cockney voice rose above the rest of the
chatter, proffering encouragement and information.
</p>

<p>
"You'll be surprised!" she declared.  "You won't
want to leave, ever&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Chill silence from us.
</p>

<p>
"You'll see it's a fine life when you get your hand
in at the work," she continued, undaunted by our
silence.  "Tomorrow morning you start.  I'll take
you along to Mr. Price; he's the farmer at the Practice
place.  Oh, he's all right, Mr. Price is; and her, too.
They won't be hard on you, seeing you've never worked
before....  Oh!  You have worked? ... Oh, in business.
Ah! that's a lady's job.  This other's all
right, though.  Don't you go telling 'em you know all
about farming just because you've made hay once or
twice on your holidays&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't," I assured her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Well, I did.  Talk about laugh ever since!"
chuckled Vic.  "Why, you don't know how much you
don't know until you start in the Land Army!  Why,
one of the wounded Tommies from the hospital here
says to me on the road just now, 'Are you on the land,
miss?' I said, 'Well, I'm not on the sea!'"
</p>

<p>
Much appreciative laughter from her friends
greeted this repartee, which, I believe, was then
new.
</p>

<p>
"'No,' he says to me, 'but I bet you was all at
sea the first time you tried to milk the cow!' I says,
'You're right!'  I was, too!  You see how you get
on with it," to me.  "Seven o'clock they milk."
</p>

<p>
"Seven!" I murmured, dismayed.  In London I
was never out of bed before the postman knocked.
</p>

<p>
"And where," asked Elizabeth, speaking for the
first time, "where is this farm we've got to go to
in the morning?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Holiday's?  Oh, a lovely place!  Great big
dairy farm that they've turned into this training
centre for us.  Only about a mile off from here."
</p>

<p>
"A mile!" I echoed blankly.  "How do we get
there, please?"
</p>

<p>
"Get there?  Well, how d'you think?" retorted Vic
gaily.  "We walk, of course."
</p>

<p>
Walk!  I wondered how long it was since I'd walked
a whole mile before today.  Walk!  A mile before
the day's work began?  Oh!  I was not the sort of
girl who ought to dream of attempting this sort of
life!  All these others were overwhelmingly fit and
healthy.  You could see they were strong as horses,
gay as larks!  They must have been picked girls for
the job.
</p>

<p>
Well, ¬£2 would buy me out!
</p>

<p>
The girl in the sweater and breeches, who had
been ironing out her smock, now put it on, all crisp.
She also pinned a pink rose to the breast of it with a
regimental brooch.
</p>

<p>
"Boys to meet, Peggy!" called the girl at the
piano.  Now, her voice was neither Cockney nor
Welsh, but that of what was once called "the
governing class."  What a queer mixture they were here!
</p>

<p>
Peggy looked demure and remarked:
</p>

<p>
"I'm astonished at you," and strolled forth into
the evening sunlight.
</p>

<p>
"Her young gentleman's in the hospital here," Vic
informed us.  "There's some real nice wounded boys
there now.  But for those, we girls might forget what
a young man looked like."
</p>

<p>
Here Elizabeth spoke for the second time, looking,
for the first time, a shade happier.  She inquired "Ah,
don't they allow men here?"
</p>

<p>
Chorus of variously accented "No's."  With cheerful
resignation Vic added, "Young men's very strictly
rationed in this camp.  Only our Mr. Price from the
farm (o' course he's big enough to count for three!)
and Mr. Rhys&mdash;the&mdash;Forestry, as they call him.
Not another man is allowed to set his foot inside this
place, so&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She broke off as if she caught sight of something.
</p>

<p>
"Whoever's this?" she ejaculated.  I, nearest the
open window, followed her look.
</p>

<p>
Two men, a little one and a tall one in khaki, were
walking quickly up the path to the camp.
</p>

<p>
A young man in khaki, wearing a Sam Browne!
</p>

<p>
This sight was hardly a rarity to Elizabeth and
me, fresh from London.  So we were fairly taken
aback at the reception of the phenomenon here, in
this far-away rural camp of Land Girls.
</p>

<p>
Excitedly Vic at the window reported.
</p>

<p>
"Here's our Mr. Rhys, bringing in an officer!"
</p>

<p>
Sensation!
</p>

<p>
"An officer?" cried twenty voices at once.
</p>

<p>
"An officer?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure it is an officer?"
</p>

<p>
"Some one from the hospital&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No officers there!  Who can it be?"
</p>

<p>
"Friend of yours, Sybil!"&mdash;this to the girl who
had been playing the piano.
</p>

<p>
"Somebody's boy got a commission&mdash;don't all
rush&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But already they all had made a rush to the window,
where Vic was lifting up a corner of the white
casement curtain to peep.
</p>

<p>
They crowded five deep behind her.
</p>

<p>
"It is an officer too!" announced the red-haired
girl.  "Captain!"
</p>

<p>
"I say, isn't he tall!"
</p>

<p>
"Doesn't he make carroty little Rhys look a
shrimp?"
</p>

<p>
"Dark, isn't he?  I do like dark men.  A fair man
always looks so quiet."
</p>

<p>
"Huh!  'Looks'!  This one looks 'quiet' enough,
but I daresay&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Whatever's he coming here for?"
</p>

<p>
"He's not coming in; no such luck."
</p>

<p>
"Sssssh!" hissed Vic, with the noise of an engine
letting off steam.  "He's coming in now!"
</p>

<p>
Instantly the crowd about the window scattered
like flies before a switch.  The crochet, the ironing,
the book, the washing-up, all were resumed.  It was
indeed a model camp-room, full of silently-industrious
young women, that met the eyes of the two visitors.
</p>

<p>
First the small, pink-faced man in leggings and loud
checks, with an orange moustache and a plume of
amber hair that seemed to spring up off his forehead
as he took off his hat, smiled, and nodded about to the
sedate assembly of girls.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, young ladies.  Good evening, Miss
Easton.  Brought you a caller," said Mr. Rhys.
</p>

<p>
Miss Easton, the forewoman, said "Good evening,
Mr. Rhys," as demurely as if she had no curiosity
at all about this caller.  The tall man's shape that
was darkening the doorway behind Mr. Rhys gave a
sudden abrupt movement forward.
</p>

<p>
"This," said Mr. Rhys in his pleasant Welshy voice,
"is Captain Holiday."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Rhys, putting his hat and twisty stick down
on a chair, added without further explanation, "I
told Captain Holiday I thought you wouldn't mind
letting him have a bit of a look round the place."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right, Mr. Rhys," said the forewoman,
with a little bow to acknowledge the salute of the
strange officer, who had now come right into the room.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Here I would like to give my first impression of
him, though every one knows how difficult it is to
recall an impression taken when one is too dog-tired
to notice clearly, or to care what any fresh person
is like.
</p>

<p>
I suppose I must have seen mechanically that this
young man was of a light and active build, and that he
had what people call a "nice" face, open, friendly,
and sunburnt.
</p>

<p>
I didn't take in then the resolute set of the mouth
under the closely-hogged russet moustache, or even
see what sort of eyes he'd got.  I know now that they
are handsome, grey-blue eyes, set deep behind a thick
fringe of brown.  Sweet eyes, with that look in them
that means, "Do like me!"  A look so often
contradicted in a man's face by the obdurate line and
tilt of the jaw, which would try to proclaim, "I don't
care a dash whether people like me or not."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
All this was lost on me that first moment.  I just
noticed the gay ribbon on Captain Holiday's well-worn
khaki jacket, with two gold stripes at the cuff.
</p>

<p>
Then I could not help noticing something rather odd
about the young man&mdash;namely, the quick, searching
glance that he sent all round the big room, taking in
every Land Girl there.  Was he looking for some
one?  But no.  After passing every girl, that
searchlight glance found me&mdash;and it held me!  Yes; it
was at me, who'd never seen him in my life before, that
he seemed to stare hardest of all!  Why?
</p>

<p>
Then I thought it must be my imagination that this
stranger was staring at all.  Possibly he was just
shortsighted, and saw nothing but what was just
under his nose.  I turned what attention I had to the
golden-and-white collie who trailed in behind him.
</p>

<p>
Led by the instinct these creatures have for an
admirer, she sidled up to me.
</p>

<p>
Her master was not too shortsighted, then, to
see this!  For he took two hasty strides right across
the room, bringing him up to where I sat with Elizabeth;
he gave a little quick soft whistle, and instantly
the collie sidled away again to her master's
riding-booted heel.
</p>

<p>
I had just time to suppose that this Captain
Holiday&mdash;whoever he might be&mdash;was about to say
something friendly and pleasant when he spoke.
</p>

<p>
The voice that came out of that nice, friendly face
was brusque and deep and carrying.  The words that
were set to that perfectly charming smile were
unexpected enough.
</p>

<p>
He demanded, still without taking his eyes from
my face:
</p>

<p>
"You're new, aren't you?  How long do you
imagine that you're going to stick this?"
</p>

<p>
I looked up.  For a moment I scarcely knew
whether I had understood.  Had he really asked that
blunt, uncivil question?
</p>

<p>
"Were you speaking to me?" I said.
</p>

<p>
He nodded.
</p>

<p>
"To you?  Yes, of course I was."
</p>

<p>
Indignantly surprised, I met his look again&mdash;steady,
measuring, disconcerting.  Then I felt a perfect
fool, in that stiff, new-smelling uniform for which
I felt&mdash;in both senses&mdash;so unfitted.  Then I blushed.
After which, naturally, I felt I should hate him for ever.
</p>

<p>
He waited; for some reason he was obviously
determined that I should speak again.  I don't know
what I should have answered; I think I just meant to
reply, "I don't know," but at that moment little
Mr. Rhys came up to call his attention to the time.
</p>

<p>
"If you want to get on to the farm, Captain
Holiday&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Righto," said this odd Captain Holiday.
</p>

<p>
He gave a last half-smiling glance at me, and something
that might have been a little gesture of taking
leave.
</p>

<p>
Then he turned to say "Good-bye" to the forewoman.
</p>

<p>
A moment later I realized that he and Mr. Rhys
had left the hut.
</p>

<p>
For immediately the normal noise of the place burst
out afresh, like a stream released from the dam.
Down, with a bang, went the iron on the stand.  Away
into corners flew the book, the blouse-mending, the
crochet, the letter-writing pad.  Chattering and
laughing, the Land Girls rushed five deep to the
window again.
</p>

<p>
"There they go!"
</p>

<p>
"Fancy a man about this place!  First thing you
could call a man that's been in here since we started!"
</p>

<p>
"What a shame," from the deep-voiced Welsh girl.
"Why couldn't you call our nice little Mr. Rhys 'a
man'?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, him!  He's in and out every day.  Can't call
that 'a man' about the place.  More like a
husband!" from another.  "Miss Easton, whoever was
the officer?"
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't tell you.  You heard Mr. Rhys say he
was Captain Holiday, and that's all I know."
</p>

<p>
"'Holiday.'  Wonder if that's got anything to do
with the farm?"
</p>

<p>
Here, as the men passed by my window, I caught a
few words, uttered by that carrying voice.  The
stranger was saying: "What was the name of that
girl I spoke to?"
</p>

<p>
What, I thought, irritably, had my name got to do
with him?  Again I felt the stab of anger with which
I'd heard him ask me how long I thought I was going
to stand "this"&mdash;the Land Army and roughing it in
camp.  Impertinence!  Anyhow, I was at the end of
my tether for tonight.  Aching with fatigue, I got
up and approached the laughing Vic.
</p>

<p>
"Please," I asked her, "could you show us where
the bedrooms are?"
</p>

<p>
"Bedrooms?" echoed the big Land Girl, and then
burst into a fresh peal of laughter.  "Bedrooms?
Hear that, girls?  Celery-face wants to know where
the bedrooms are!"  General laughter.  "No luxuries
of that sort here, dear.  As you were!  Here's
where we all sleep."
</p>

<p>
Blankly Elizabeth and I gazed about that bleak
hall.
</p>

<p>
"On the floor," added Vic cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
"Floor!" I repeated, giving an appalled glance
down at those hard scrubbed boards.
</p>

<p>
But here our Cockney friend relented.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, it's not come to that yet, even in the Land
Army," she said.  "Here, I'll show you."  She put
a large brown hand on the arm of each of us, led us
to the further end of the hall and pulled aside a
curtain.
</p>

<p>
Behind it an alcove was piled with rolled-up
mattresses.
</p>

<p>
"We drag these out, d'you see," explained Vic.
"Lay 'em in a line along the wall here.  Here's two
for you&mdash;here's your blankets.  I'll tuck you up
in your little byes.  Sleep like tops here, see if you
don't."
</p>

<p>
I was amazed to find how cosily I curled up, presently
on that mattress without sheets or pillows, set
on the floor near that open window through which the
air swept sweet with the breath of growing things.
Vic tucked the khaki blankets round me with a gesture
that I hadn't seen so near me since I lost my mother.
</p>

<p>
"Sleep well," she said comfortably.  "Dream of
'him'!"
</p>

<p>
And it was into the profoundest sleep that I'd
known since Harry sailed that I presently sank.
</p>

<p>
My last waking thoughts were a jumble of the train
journey, the unfamiliar country, the laughing, rosy
faces of the Land Girls.  Then clearly there stood
out, in front of all, the face of that strange young
man who had walked into the camp, looking as if he
were searching for somebody.  That searching,
disconcerting stare of his at me&mdash;why at <i>me</i>?&mdash;that
brusque demand: "How long d'you imagine you'll
stick this?"  Why did he say that to <i>me</i>?

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br><br>
THE FIRST JOB
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
"Something attempted, something done."&mdash;LONGFELLOW.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Next morning at two o'clock&mdash;or such the
unearthly hour seemed to me&mdash;I was
awakened by a resonant girlish voice.
</p>

<p>
"Tumble up!  It's late!  I left you girls till the
last minute.  You were so dead asleep you never heard
a sound.  Up with you!"
</p>

<p>
Deeply-drowsy, bewildered, but refreshed, I
scrambled out of my blankets and blinked about.
Where was&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Ah!  The hut!
</p>

<p>
Every mattress but Elizabeth's and mine was rolled
up and stowed away.  Every "Campite" had disappeared
but big Vic and two who were on fatigue.
Vic was hooking scarlet stripes to the sleeve of her
clean smock.  The others cleared breakfast away
from the mess-table.
</p>

<p>
"You buck up and dress," Vic advised us.  "The
Timber-Girls and Miss Easton are all off to the
woods already"&mdash;this was the first I'd heard of so
many of the girls here being in the Forestry
Corps&mdash;"and the other two farm-pupils have gone on.
</p>

<p>
"It's no use you asking for any bathrooms, Celery-face,"
he added good-humouredly.  "Here's a basin.
Young Sybil always takes a dip in the pool just
outside, but you've no time today."
</p>

<p>
I also had no wish, at that moment, to go and dip
into any ice-cold, fresh-water pools, out of doors and
in the chill grey dawn.  Brrr!
</p>

<p>
"No time for you to sit down for your breakfast
either," Vic pursued, as we huddled on our unfamiliar
garments and struggled with the lacings of our
leggings.  "Lil!  Just pour these girls out their tea,
and butter 'em some bread&mdash;they must eat as they
go along."
</p>

<p>
In the early sunshine on the road Elizabeth and I
devoured the country bread and the real farm-butter.
Our guide and mentor, Vic, strode along between us in
the slouch hat, holland overall, breeches, and leggings
that looked so natural and becoming on her, though
my chum and I, glancing at each other, could not yet
grow accustomed to our own appearances.
</p>

<p>
My feet seemed to belong to somebody else, in these
boots!  They were so very different from the feet in
the shoes that had pattered down streets and along
corridors on my daily tube scramble in town!
</p>

<p>
Harry had always "noticed" what shoes I wore,
more than any other part of my get-up.  But now&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Let us go hence, my shoes, he will not see,'" I
parodied gloomily to myself as I tramped along that
lane.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Vic, cheerful as the morning, was pointing
out to us what she considered the objects of
interest as we went along.
</p>

<p>
"See that big white place over there in the trees?
That's the hospital," Vic told us, pointing.  "There's
two o' the boys coming out now&mdash;see?  This is the
turning off to the town&mdash;at least, what they call a
town.  Mouldy!  No pictures, nothing; still, why go
to theatres when you can see life?
</p>

<p>
"You ought to have been here for the concert at
the hospital last week.  It was all right.  They
wanted to give it again at our hut; but Miss Easton
and Mr. Rhys said 'No fear.'  A shame, wasn't it?
Never mind; they are going to have another, some time.
See that hill to the right where that smoke's going
up?  That's where our girls work at the trees.  And
those corrugated iron roofs you can just see over
there&mdash;that's the camp for the German prisoners, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Vic broke off to ask if she were running us off our
legs.  Certainly she was a quicker walker than either
of us.  But I enjoyed the tramp through this heavenly
air as much as I ever could enjoy anything again, I
thought, in this Harry-less world.
</p>

<p>
So far, I thought "going on the land" was not so
bad after all.  Eating delicious bread and butter
out-of-doors on a glorious morning at an hour when, in
London, I should still have been a-bed!  Not at all
bad.  It might even do a little to take my thoughts
off the wound that could not help aching for ever.
</p>

<p>
And besides this, I was conscious that in the whole
air of the place there was something as distinctive, as
familiar as in the taste of the farmhouse bread and
butter.  It was a something that I had not savoured
since I was a growing girl....
</p>

<p>
Other country landscapes that I had since seen
had always made me feel the lack of this "something." ...
</p>

<p>
That these others were often, in a different way, as
beautiful, I did admit.  I appreciated their dignity, the
prosperity of their wide, flat lands.  They had so much
that was to be admired, but not&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Ah!  Not the "flavour" of Wales!
</p>

<p>
That wild charm one can no more describe than one
could photograph the skylark's song.  But, with that
in one's blood, other charms leave one temperate.
Once tasted, never to be forgotten....  I found
myself sniffing it up now as if it were some rich and
definite perfume, instead of some atmosphere made up
of a thousand elusive things ... the dreams of
youth included!
</p>

<p>
And I was glad&mdash;that is, as glad as I could allow
myself to feel in the circumstances&mdash;that, to take up
my new venture, Fate had sent me back to the Land of
my Fathers.
</p>

<p>
"There!" exclaimed Vic presently.  "There's the farm!"
</p>

<p>
She pointed to a square building of apricot red,
backed by trees and a gently-sloping green hill.  It
had a flat slate roof, and its many windows glittered
in the sun.
</p>

<p>
With interested curiosity I gazed upon it as we
came nearer&mdash;the farm where my chum and I were
to receive our training for this new life which we'd
chosen for ourselves&mdash;on a toss-up!  That farm&mdash;stacked
with such memories for me now!  On that first
morning I wondered what it would mean for me.
</p>

<p>
"Here's our way, round by the back," Vic piloted
us.  Up a short lane we went, through a big, red
wooden gate, and into the farmyard.  It was the first
farmyard I'd been into since Dad gave up that farm
of his that had swallowed, sovereign by sovereign, all
his capital.  This other place looked&mdash;ah, how much
larger and more prosperous!
</p>

<p>
The big, oblong yard was bordered by buildings
that gave the place the air of a homely monastery
with cloisters.
</p>

<p>
By a shed door to the left a labourer in shirt-sleeves
and wearing a soldier's cap was holding a horse, and
talking to a very big man in tweeds.  As this man
turned his face I saw it was the kindest-looking one
that I had ever seen.
</p>

<p>
Vic led us up to him.
</p>

<p>
"Here's our two new pupils, Mr. Price," she
introduced us.  "This little one's Elizabeth Weare.
This other young lady with the white face is Joan
Matthews."
</p>

<p>
A very kindly smile was sent down upon us from
the top reaches of that farmer's six-foot-four.  He
was indeed a gentle giant.
</p>

<p>
"You will soon get rosy cheeks here," he assured
me.  "Yes, yes.  Vic, now, wasn't so much to look
at when she came here first, a twelvemonth ago.
Didn't like it at first!"  This with a twinkle.
"Couldn't get rid of her afterwards.  Shows she likes
it here now, doesn't it, for her to want to stay on as
instructor?"
</p>

<p>
"Instructor!" murmured Elizabeth and I together.
For the first time we realized this big, laughing
Cockney-voiced Campite was also an official.
</p>

<p>
The farmer turned away with a friendly nod to us;
and to Vic he added:
</p>

<p>
"You will put them on to their jobs of work, then,
won't you&mdash;same as I told you yesterday?"
</p>

<p>
"Right you are, Mr. Price," returned Vic briskly.
"Now, then, dear," to Elizabeth, "you'd better come
along with me.  Picking up stones for you.  I'll
show you the field that's got to be cleared."
</p>

<p>
I saw an indescribable mingling of expressions cross
Elizabeth's small face under that brand-new Land
Army hat.  Pick up stones!  The thing any child at
the seaside can do!  Was it for this that she had given
up her post as an efficient clerk and had joined the
Land Army?  Such, I know, was her thought.  But
she only said "Right!" and stood by for our
instructor's orders.
</p>

<p>
Vic turned to me.
</p>

<p>
"Now you," she went on, with a gesture towards the
shed near which that labourer had been standing.
"Here's your little job."
</p>

<p>
Now, I appeal to all you girls who joined up as I
did, ignorant and "townified," to work on the Land!
Had you any clear idea of what you thought would
be the first task to which you would be set?
</p>

<p>
I hadn't.
</p>

<p>
But Elizabeth mischievously declares that I had
already pictured my first job thus:
</p>

<p>
Scene, a shining, fragrant dairy, with roses framing
the open lattice.  Myself, in a lilac sun-bonnet,
looking like a lady land-worker out of some revue, and
wielding a snowy, carved wooden implement with which
I printed a clover-blossom design off on to innumerable
pats of golden butter.
</p>

<p>
If this was "The Ideal," how different was "The
Real" to which Vic pointed now!
</p>

<p>
My "little job"!
</p>

<p>
I had smelt it the moment that I'd entered the
farmyard.  As a child I'd seen Dad's roughest farm-lad
engaged upon a similar "little job," and I'd been
sorry for him&mdash;it had seemed not only such hard
work, but so disgusting!
</p>

<p>
It involved spade work and a pitchfork, a wheelbarrow
and the midden in the centre of the yard, on
which a speckled hen and her brood were peering and
running about.  It also involved a dive into dark and
very evil-smelling recesses, with noisome straw
underfoot and festoons of grey cobwebs overhead.  Never
had I thought I should set foot&mdash;or nose&mdash;in such a
place.
</p>

<p>
But it was in tones of the cheeriest matter-of-course
that Vic concluded:
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you start cleaning out that cow-house."
</p>

<p>
That cow-house!  Start cleaning it out!  I&mdash;&mdash;!
</p>

<p>
Vic gave me my tools, bore off Elizabeth, and left
me to it.
</p>

<p>
There I stood in the farmyard&mdash;I, the would-be
farm-worker, to whom "work" had always meant sitting
indoors and checking papers and clicking a typewriter!
</p>

<p>
Well, I must make a beginning.
</p>

<p>
I made the beginning that beginners do make&mdash;namely,
I went at it like a bull at a gate.
</p>

<p>
With my hands that had not held any tool heavier
than a fountain-pen, I grasped, I clutched the
spade-handle, that felt so huge and so unwieldy.  Violently
I drove that spade into that brown and malodorous
mass at my feet.  Ugh!  Violently I tried to raise the
heavy spadeful of that horror.  It was too heavy to
lift.  I struggled.
</p>

<p>
At the third or fourth effort I heaved the load up.
Wildly I cast the foul burden into the wheelbarrow.
I missed it by half, though; half that spadeful fell
upon my boots and upon my immaculate gaiters.
How revolting.  I stamped myself free, shuddering.
</p>

<p>
Savagely I stooped to my loathsome task.  I dug,
heaved, threw.  In ten minutes I was hot, dripping,
exhausted.  My arms shook and twitched with over-exertion.
</p>

<p>
And with a sudden more violent lunge than any of
the others, I thrust my spade into the half-heaped
barrow and left it.
</p>

<p>
I'd made up my mind.  I wasn't going to stick this.
I'd buy myself out.  Going back to London offices
and tightly-shut windows would be anyhow better than
this.
</p>

<p>
I'd go!  Yes!  Now!
</p>

<p>
Hurriedly I began pulling down the sleeves of the
smock that I'd rolled up above my elbows.  I'd got
one sleeve down, when the shed-door was suddenly
darkened.  A man's shape shut out the glimpse of
farmyard.  A man's eyes were upon me with an
amused and curious stare.
</p>

<p>
I recognized him.
</p>

<p>
Yes!  He was that young officer who had taken it
upon himself, last night at the hut, to ask me how
long I thought I should stick this.
</p>

<p>
Of course, he would&mdash;he would choose this moment
to come upon me again!
</p>

<p>
Angry was not the word for my feelings towards
the young man!
</p>

<p>
This was unfair.  But it didn't affect him.  He
looked at me, and at the one sleeve that I had rolled
down again.  He gave the honeyed smile that every
Land Girl at the camp had noticed for its sweetness.
And then, in the brusque voice that was such a
contrast to the smile, he said&mdash;without even a "good
morning":
</p>

<p>
"Any one could see that you had never set foot on
a farm before."
</p>

<p>
"How d'you know I haven't?  As it happens I
have!" I retorted crossly, and again I caught up
the spade that I'd flung into the barrow.
</p>

<p>
"Anyhow, you don't know how to handle those
things," he said, moving forward.  "That's not the
way to hold a spade."
</p>

<p>
Without more ado he took the spade out of my
hands, holding it lightly.  He drove it without violence
into the foul mess that heaped the floor, taking
up about half the quantity that I had done.
</p>

<p>
"You'll find," he remarked, "that if you don't overload
the spade it will balance itself.  Same with the
pitchfork.  Let the work do itself.  Look."
</p>

<p>
He let that spade swing back, and the weight on
it swung forward to the barrow with almost no
exertion at all.
</p>

<p>
"Let weight weigh on your side," he said, driving
in the spade.  "Let force force.  Let gravity grav.
You see what I mean."
</p>

<p>
He gave me a little nod as I watched.
</p>

<p>
"You'll find," he said again, "that you can't fight
nature.  You can make her work for you, though."
</p>

<p>
Turning to the wheelbarrow, he picked up the
handles of it and trundled it out into the sunny
farmyard.  Not quite knowing what he would be at, I
followed the light figure in khaki towards that mound
of unspeakableness, where the grey hen clucked to
her young.  A board slanted up the side of it.
The young man turned to speak to me as he trundled.
</p>

<p>
"The same with the barrow," Captain Holiday went
on.  "You don't let it stand still at the foot of that
plank and then heave it up.  You heave it along the
level here, where it's easiest.  Then it'll go halfway
up by itself.  Like this."
</p>

<p>
Easily he ran the barrow halfway up the plank.
Then, when I thought he was going to tip it over,
he let it run down again, and wheeled it back with
its noisome load to the cowshed.
</p>

<p>
"D'ye see?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  But you might have emptied it for me," I
suggested, "while you'd got it there."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," he said coolly, "that's not the idea."  Then,
quickly: "Won't you roll that sleeve of yours
up again?"
</p>

<p>
This with a twinkle?
</p>

<p>
I bit my lip.
</p>

<p>
Of course he had caught me out in the very act of
"chucking it."  This made me all the more furious
because I couldn't show it.  Who was this Captain
Holiday who permeated this district, asking leading
questions of land-workers, and, without encouragement,
showing them how and how not to do their work?
Surely it was hardly any business of his, after all?
</p>

<p>
In what I meant to be a crushing tone, I asked
him:
</p>

<p>
"Do you wheel many barrows in the Army?"
</p>

<p>
He replied cheerfully, and in a disarmingly boyish
manner:
</p>

<p>
"It's just the same principle if you're swinging a
bayonet.  They're both weights.  Now, you try
again."
</p>

<p>
And I actually found myself rolling up my sleeves
again and&mdash;obeying orders!
</p>

<p>
Yes!  I did as I was told by this incredible young
man, as I called him inwardly at the time.
</p>

<p>
I see now what he meant.  Any other man would
have gone on doing my work while I leaned against
the edge of the stall.  He made me do it myself, and
at the exact moment when I'd decided I'd had enough
of it!
</p>

<p>
"Take a rest now," broke in this Captain Holiday
after he'd watched me critically for some minutes.
"Resting is just as important as thrusting."
</p>

<p>
He drew up a long wooden crate near the
cow-house door.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down," he ordered.
</p>

<p>
I did, still wondering half-exasperatedly who this
tall young captain was.
</p>

<p>
Did he think that just because I was on the land
I was to be spoken to by any stranger who drifted
along?  If so&mdash;well!
</p>

<p>
I was just wondering how I had better show him
very plainly that he'd made a big mistake, when again
I was disarmed by the sight of that charming smile.
No man with a smile like that could make that kind of
mistake.  But again the smile was accompanied by
the bluntest remark.
</p>

<p>
"You were jacking up just now, weren't you?
Thinking you'd chuck the whole show?"
</p>

<p>
This nettled me exceedingly.
</p>

<p>
"No!  I was doing nothing of the kind," I
replied hotly.
</p>

<p>
"You know quite well that you were," he retorted
quickly.  "But you will always contradict me, and I
shall never admit what you say.  That's understood."
</p>

<p>
Evidently he meant that our acquaintance was to
go on, whatever I intended.
</p>

<p>
He crossed his legs and pulled a loose nail out of
the side of the crate on which we sat.  I hadn't asked
him to sit down by me.  That, too, he'd taken as a
matter of course.
</p>

<p>
Was this young soldier some relation of Mr. Price?
Had he anything to do with this farm?  Or did he
just appoint himself instructor to any Land Girl he
happened to meet?
</p>

<p>
Hoping to find out what his position was, I asked
vaguely, but more politely than I had spoken before:
</p>

<p>
"Are you stationed here?"
</p>

<p>
"Here in this cowshed?" Captain Holiday asked
blandly.
</p>

<p>
At this I told him, quite shortly, not to be silly.
</p>

<p>
Whereupon he laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, if you mean for a mile or two round
here"&mdash;he gave a little circular jerk of his head&mdash;"I
suppose I am.  My house is here.  You haven't seen
my house yet, but you'd pass it coming from the
camp.  It's that white place in the trees beyond the
hill."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;that's the hospital.  Then you're wounded,"&mdash;I
glanced at his gold stripes&mdash;"or still sick?"
</p>

<p>
"That doesn't follow.  What I mean is that it's
my house."
</p>

<p>
"Then you turned it into a hospital?"
</p>

<p>
"No," replied this puzzling young man quietly.
Then added, as if he were speaking to one of his own
soldiers: "Come along.  Time's up!  Take a turn
with the spade again.  And see if you can make the
wheelbarrow go up easily next journey."
</p>

<p>
As I took up the spade again he strolled out of the
shed.  I thought he was not even going to have the
manners to bid me good morning.  But he turned his
face, and said laughingly over his shoulder:
</p>

<p>
"Au revoir&mdash;unless you mean to jack up before I
see you again?"
</p>

<p>
Without waiting for a reply, he crossed the yard
towards the farmhouse.
</p>

<p>
I went on with my so-far-from-romantic task, a little
surprised to find that there did seem to be something
in what this Captain Holiday had said about handling
spades and wheeling barrows.  His was the better
way, after all.  I tried to follow it.  I still found the
unusual exercise was labour; but it was not altogether
the struggle that it had been at my first ignorant and
violent efforts.
</p>

<p>
I worked, getting more flushed and moist and
dishevelled as the cleared space on the slate floor
grew&mdash;very gradually&mdash;larger.
</p>

<p>
There&mdash;I'd managed to tip the barrow over quite
neatly that time.  I wished I could turn through that
cow-house the canal of which I saw the silver blink
between meadows beyond the stack-roofs.  That
would be "making Nature work for one" with a
vengeance!
</p>

<p>
Now!  This time the spade seemed ever so much
lighter, and yet I'd managed to get quite a good load
on to it.
</p>

<p>
Presently I was startled to hear a bell clanging
noisily across the yard.  A woman's voice called to
some one "Dinner!"

CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
THE FARMHOUSE MEAL
</h3>

<p class="intro">
"Thank God and the Land Army for my good dinner; Amen."&mdash;GRACE (revised).<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Dinner!  At the word there invaded me an
extraordinary feeling, to which I'd been a
stranger for months in town.  What was it?&mdash;hunger,
ravenous and primitive&mdash;fervently I hoped
that this summons meant dinner for everybody!
</p>

<p>
I glanced at my filthy forearms and hands.
Remembering my "blunder" about the bedrooms in camp,
I did not look for anybody to tell me where the
bathroom was.
</p>

<p>
I made for the pump in the yard.  And then, as
I dried my arms and face as well as I could on a
comparatively clean piece of my smock, I heard a
good-natured Cockney voice behind me say:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, look at Celery Face sluicing herself in a young
cataract!"
</p>

<p>
Turning, I found big Vic coming up with Elizabeth.
My chum's small face was redder than I had
ever seen it.  It wore an "in-for-a-penny-in-for-a-pound"
expression, and her uniform (though not
filthy like mine) was no longer the immaculate fancy
dress that it had seemed on the road to work.
</p>

<p>
Vic grinned.
</p>

<p>
"This little 'un is going to shape fine, only for
breaking her back nearly," she told me.  "How've
you been getting on, young Joan?  Let's have a
look at your shed.  Yes, that's the style.  This 'ere
job will be part of your cowman's test, you know.
Cleaning out shed, maximum 10 marks.  Seventy-five
per cent. marks you've got to get in the tests before
you pass out of here and get a swanky post somewhere,
and be a credit to your instructress, don't you
forget it!"
</p>

<p>
I couldn't help laughing as we followed her up to
the farmhouse.
</p>

<p>
"Instructress, indeed!" I exclaimed.  "I was expecting
some 'instruction,' and you never came!  You
never even showed me how to hold the spade."
</p>

<p>
Vic flashed upon me her most teasing grin.
</p>

<p>
"I did come," she said with a nod.  "Only you
weren't wanting any 'instruction,' I noticed, from
little Me.  Went away again, I did&mdash;hooked it.  You
were all right.  Never even saw me.  You and your
landowner!"
</p>

<p>
Before I could ask what Vic meant by "my landowner"
we were all in the big front kitchen, with
its dresser, its tridarn (or three-decker oaken chest),
its grandfather clock, and its long table set for seven.
</p>

<p>
This was the first time Elizabeth or I had sat
down to dinner in a kitchen.  Much we should have
cared had it been in the scullery, the barn, or the
hen-house!  There is no appetite like that which comes
from physical toil!
</p>

<p>
Glorious greed was a delicious sauce&mdash;if any sauce
had been needed&mdash;to the plentiful and savoury
farm-house meal that was provided for us of boiled bacon,
potatoes, greens, butter, bread, buttermilk, fruit tart,
and cheese.
</p>

<p>
At the risk of writing myself down a glutton&mdash;or
of reading like an advertisement for somebody's
cocoa&mdash;I must dwell on the taste of that loaf, that
butter, those other wholesome and delicious things
with their suggestion of building healthy bodies and
reddening rosy cheeks&mdash;the food with which England
should be fed.
</p>

<p>
"Everything home-grown!" we were smilingly told
by Mrs. Price, the farmer's wife, who took one end
of the table, while her husband carved at the other.
Their own dining-room in the front of the house was
exquisite with old oak and the silver pots of two
generations of agricultural prize-winners; but they
elected to share their Land Girls' kitchen dinner
because it seemed more hospitable and homely.
</p>

<p>
"There's nothing here that hasn't come off the
farm," Mrs. Price added.  "Those black currants
in the tart are my last year's bottling, of course.  But
they were straight out of the garden here.  I expect
you find it dreadfully countrified fare after
London&mdash;those of you that come from there."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth and I here spared a moment from revelling
in our second helpings of those home-grown
vegetables, so efficiently cooked, to look up and laugh.
What we were both thinking of was our last, farewell,
midday meal in town.
</p>

<p>
It had consisted of:
</p>

<p>
(1) Hors d'≈ìuvre, highly vinegary and
suspect&mdash;tasting of nothing on earth.
</p>

<p>
(2) A morsel of sole that had distinctly not come
"straight" out of the sea, and tasting of the fact.
</p>

<p>
(3) Escaloppes de veau with tomato sauce.  I
don't know what they tasted of, though they cost us
a meat-ticket; they smelt, too, forbiddingly of the
substitute fat in which they'd been fried.
</p>

<p>
(4) A small greyish roll, tasting of sawdust.
</p>

<p>
(5) One half peach, tasting of tin.
</p>

<p>
(6) Black coffee, tasting of dish-cloth, with a
virulently green liqueur that we hoped might drown the
tastes of the other courses, and a cheap cigarette.
</p>

<p>
England's lunch!
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Certainly life was a succession of contrasts.  From
the dark fugginess of that crowded little Italian
restaurant&mdash;which I'd loved because Harry "discovered"
it&mdash;to this spotless Welsh kitchen where the
kindly farm people "mothered" the five girls in
farm-kit&mdash;Vic, Elizabeth, myself and the other two more
advanced pupils.  One of these was "Sybil," who had
played the piano at the Hut last night, and who took
her dip in the pool before going to work; the other
was a bright-looking girl they called "Curley," though
her hair was the straightest imaginable.
</p>

<p>
That gentle giant, Mr. Price, had a word for each
as he carved.
</p>

<p>
"I like to know something about all you young
ladies who've come down here to work," he said to
me.  "A lot we've had down here since the start.
Twenty, I think, coming and going; splendid girls&mdash;good
little workers, all.  And some were one thing
and some another.  From South Wales the two last
were who were here; fathers in the collieries.  Then
there's Curley," he nodded at her, "all her people
in works, Birmingham.  And Sybil here," with
another nod, "from Buckinghamshire, never been away
from home before without a maid, she told my wife.
Father a general.  May I ask if your father was in
the Army too, perhaps?"
</p>

<p>
"No; my father wasn't in anything particular," I
said.  "He used to do a little bit of farming himself."
</p>

<p>
A gleam of interest lighted up the giant's blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Dear me!  Farmed himself, did he?  How big a
farm, missy?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, not big at all.  Nor at all successful!" I
told him ruefully.  "I'm afraid he just lost money
over it about seven years ago."
</p>

<p>
More interest from this other, prosperous-looking
farmer.
</p>

<p>
"Farming," he told me gravely, "was no life for
a man in this country until just lately.  An existence,
that was all.  All the food we ought to have grown
came in from over the sea.  Agriculture, before the
war, was simply hand to mouth, hand to mouth."  He
looked at his wife and added: "If it hadn't been for
pedigree poultry and shire horses the farmers would
have starved."
</p>

<p>
His wife nodded across the table; she was the sort
of small, dainty little woman that you would expect
that great-framed man to choose; her thick hair was
prematurely grey, and her well-cut and tiny features,
though composed, seemed as if they had looked on
struggles in her time.
</p>

<p>
Then came something that, though it was only talk
at a farmhouse table, was significant.  It made me
think.  This new problem of my life on the land was
full of old problems to others.  Across that liberally-spread
board that farmer's wife launched an astonishing
remark.
</p>

<p>
"We nearly starved," she said, "when we were
children in my father's time.  One New Year he made
up his accounts and he was down a thousand pounds.
The next year again he was down a thousand.  And
the third year again he had lost another thousand.
That January, I remember, he did not speak for a
week."
</p>

<p>
Her soft voice shook.  The faces of the Land Girls
were all turned towards her, listening, surprised.
</p>

<p>
"Then," continued Mrs. Price, "he came into our
nursery and said, 'Children, I'm broke.  The dear old
home will have to go.'"
</p>

<p>
Here the Land Girl Sybil put in gently:
</p>

<p>
"But you told me your brother had that farm now.
So you didn't have to leave, Mrs. Price?"
</p>

<p>
"No!  Because of my father fighting for it.  He
borrowed money at very high interest and went in for
shire horses.  In ten years he was just feeling his
feet again.  It was twenty years before he paid off
everything.  That was a struggle.  Those were the
hard times for farmers.  It makes me feel bitter now,
girls, when they say farmers are 'grasping,' and
'make money hand over fist,' just because the tide has
turned at last, and farming isn't the terribly losing
game it was!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it'll never be so again, I hope," her husband
assured her.  Then he beamed about the table and
added: "Not with all these young ladies here turning
out to help like this!  And that one," nodding at me,
"a farmer's daughter herself!  Where is your father
living now, then?"
</p>

<p>
I told him the name of the village on the borderline
between England and Wales.
</p>

<p>
"Not so far from here, then.  Fifty miles off,
perhaps.  They'll be able to come down and see how you
are getting on."
</p>

<p>
But here Vic broke in mischievously over her bread
and cheese.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you worry, Mr. Price.  She isn't going
to bust herself with any homesickness.  She don't
want any more people.  She's got off with a young
man of her own down here already."
</p>

<p>
Here Elizabeth must needs turn her head sharply, to
glance at me with an inquiry full of rebuke; uttering it
aloud as well.  "What young man?"
</p>

<p>
I took no notice of her.  I looked at the others; the
others who did not think (as she did) that I was far too
fond of the whole Repulsive Sex.
</p>

<p>
"There was no young man&mdash;I mean, not in that
sort of way at all&mdash;Vic's talking nonsense to tease
me!" I assured the party, definitely.
</p>

<p>
"It was simply that Captain Holiday&mdash;whoever he
is, he seems to think he can go anywhere and do
anything&mdash;came into the shed where I was working and
gave me a few tips about my work."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Captain Holiday.  Yes.  It was him you
were asking about, Vic," said Mr. Price, his blue eyes
interested again.  "Yes, he's our landlord here now
that poor old Mr. Holiday's gone.  Most of the
property about belongs to him.  The hospital, and your
camp, and this farm, and all.  A great interest he
takes in all of it.  All over it he was this morning.  So
he went and showed this young lady how to set about
her job?  Very obliging of him."
</p>

<p>
Vic again retorted teasingly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know so much!  I haven't noticed
that young men are so nice and 'obliging' over helping
girls with their jobs without they're interested in
the girls themselves!"
</p>

<p>
I really failed to see why every one of the other girls
should seem to take such a vivid interest in this
argument&mdash;particularly Elizabeth, who ought to have
known better!
</p>

<p>
Quite nettled, I put in quickly:
</p>

<p>
"Personally I shouldn't call this Captain Holiday a
very 'obliging' young man."  I was thinking of the
way in which he'd trundled that wheelbarrow back
with its noisome load, instead of emptying it for me,
and I concluded, "Rather annoying, I should call him."
</p>

<p>
Then I was sorry I'd said that.  Mr. Price, who
had unfolded his long legs from under the table and
was rising to his feet at the end of the meal, looked
grave and gave me a quick glance.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed?" he said seriously.  "I am sorry to
hear it.  I can't have anything like that, landlord
or no landlord.  If Captain Holiday was annoying
one of my workers, I shall have to tell him&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, please don't," I put in hastily.  "I didn't
mean that kind of 'annoying' at all.  I only meant
I was rather annoyed that any one should see I
was such a raw beginner at my job.  That was all."
</p>

<p>
In common fairness to the young man I felt I had
to speak up for him to that extent.  On returning to
my cow-house I forgot all about him, forgot even that
it was he who'd saved me from half the difficulty of
my task.  It was not all drudgery, when one found out
the best and quickest way of doing what was so new
to me&mdash;manual work.
</p>

<p>
Thankful enough was I, though, to knock off!
</p>

<p>
But on the way home Elizabeth brought up Captain
Holiday again.
</p>

<p>
"Joan," she began, "what do you think of that

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Severely I looked at my chum.
</p>

<p>
She and I were walking down the road between
the flowering hedges back to camp behind Vic,
Sybil, and Curley.
</p>

<p>
Now the other two pupils&mdash;who had wound up
their day's work by milking, which we had been sent
to watch&mdash;had knocked off obviously as fresh as
paint.  Elizabeth, too, made no complaint of feeling
tired after her day's stone-picking.  She strode along
manfully, and I thought that the rather wooden way
she moved was just because of the clumsy land-boots.
</p>

<p>
So that I vowed to myself that I'd never let her
know what I'd begun to feel, after the midday rest,
and in every muscle, namely, the relentless strain of
unusual physical exertion.
</p>

<p>
Ah!  How it had got me!
</p>

<p>
The first game of tennis, the first bicycle ride, the
first row, the first long tramp of a summer
holiday&mdash;everybody knows the ache that comes after these.
Multiply that ache by fifty, and you'll have some
idea of what happens after the first day's land-work.
Personally I felt it would be all I could do to drag
my stiffening limbs back to the hut!
</p>

<p>
I also felt that for Elizabeth to cross-question me
at this moment was adding insult to aches.  After
staring at dinner, too!
</p>

<p>
"Elizabeth, you are a little owl," I informed her.
"I know what you imagine.  Can't any sort of young
man say a word to me without it's starting some idea
of a love-affair?"
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth, set-faced, said coolly, "Apparently not."
</p>

<p>
I straightened my back indignantly.  Then caught
my breath because it hurt me so.  Hoping she hadn't
noticed this, I demanded, "What d'you mean by that?"
</p>

<p>
"Wherever you go, Joan, young men always seem
to break out," Elizabeth replied rebukefully.
</p>

<p>
She spoke the words "young men" just as Farmer
Price might have mentioned caterpillars in his
standing crops.
</p>

<p>
"You forget that I came down here just because
I'd had enough of them!" I said wearily.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth, scowling:
</p>

<p>
"We've only just finished with the eternal Harry.
For a year he monopolized you; nobody else existed!
Then he went, leaving you without an ounce of go or
fun in you&mdash;anyhow, he did go; at last.  But the very
day he'd gone you got a proposal from that other
Man-thing; what was his name?"
</p>

<p>
"D'you mean Richard Wynn?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  There was that.  Well, you lost his letter.
So he was off&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Shouldn't have taken him, anyhow," I protested.
</p>

<p>
"You said you would."
</p>

<p>
"People will say anything," I defended myself,
"after a day like I'd just had in that office."
</p>

<p>
"I sometimes think you'd be quite silly enough to
accept him yet," declared my candid friend as we
tramped past the park trees that gave a glimpse of
the white hospital.  "But then we come down here.
And the very first evening&mdash;what happens?  A third
young man crops up!"
</p>

<p>
"He didn't crop up to see me."
</p>

<p>
"Curious that you should be the only girl in the
camp that he picked out to speak to," sniffed
Elizabeth.  "And that the next morning he should make
a bee line for that cow-house of yours, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Here she broke off with an alarmingly sudden little
screech of "Ow!"
</p>

<p>
I stopped.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter!"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," retorted Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"My dear old girl, what is it?" I insisted
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
Then she laughed.  She blurted out quickly:
</p>

<p>
"It's only that&mdash;the more I move the more it hurts
me!  Oh, Joan, I'm sore!  That's why I snapped at
you so crossly.  They say 'Cross as a bear with a
sore paw'&mdash;but&mdash;but I'm sore everywhere!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  So am I!" I groaned, laughing with the
relief of the confession.  "I feel as if I'd got fifty new
bones."
</p>

<p>
"So do I!"
</p>

<p>
"All hurting me like mad!"
</p>

<p>
"So are mine!" declared Elizabeth, hobbling.
"Well, I suppose we'll get used to it.  They say this
wears off.  Let's hope for the best&mdash;and for goodness'
sake don't let us squabble."
</p>

<p>
"I never want to!"
</p>

<p>
"Righto.  And tell me," continued my chum, "what
you really do think of that young man Captain Holiday?"
</p>

<p>
I couldn't help laughing.  If Elizabeth wants to
get at anything, it comes off in the long run.  So, as
we hobbled stiffly down the road together, I told her
as much as I did "think" on the score of this new
acquaintance.  I described the cow-house scene.
</p>

<p>
"Such a truly idyllic setting," I chaffed her, "for
any sort of a <i>t√™te-√†-t√™te</i>!"
</p>

<p>
I repeated the young man's remarks about the way
to "make work do itself, and to let gravity grav."  I
told her how he'd made me roll down my sleeves
again, and had ordered me about generally.
</p>

<p>
"I think he's rather a domineerer.  But he is a
sahib, of course.  He's rather original, too.  And
almost the rudest person I've met," I said critically.
"He is the rudest, next to you."
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth said blandly:
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and yet you've always liked me most awfully.
I suppose you'll soon find out how much you
like him."
</p>

<p>
I began to say, "We shall probably never see the
man again," but remembered that he was the owner of
this land on which we toiled, and that it would sound
silly.  So I merely said:
</p>

<p>
"I don't dislike him at all."
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth shook her bobbed hair against her cheeks.
Grimly, fatalistically, she added:
</p>

<p>
"I know you're going to like him horribly."
</p>

<p>
"I know your poor little sore bones have affected
your brain!" I told her.  "Haven't I just had one
'doing' over liking some one too horribly?  Yet, in
the middle of that, you say&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It isn't the middle," Elizabeth returned very
quickly, "it is coming to the end."
</p>

<p>
"What!"
</p>

<p>
"It is the beginning of the end.  You won't go
on thinking of Harry to the end of your days."
</p>

<p>
"Much you know about it, child!" I said, and as
I spoke the wide sun-lighted green lands faded from
before me, and I saw Harry's polished black head
above the pink lights of a restaurant table&mdash;Harry's
handsome, straying eyes.  "The thought never leaves
me, Elizabeth."
</p>

<p>
"Hasn't it left you once today?"
</p>

<p>
Here&mdash;well, it was the greatest surprise to me,
but I did have to straighten my mouth out of a smile.
Today?  The thought of Harry had certainly been
somewhat overlaid by&mdash;cow-house.  But I said:
</p>

<p>
"It's there always, worse luck, at the back of my
mind."
</p>

<p>
"Making more room in front," said my impish
chum.  "You're better about him already."
</p>

<p>
Patiently I sighed.
</p>

<p>
"You're better," insisted Elizabeth, "even this little
time away in this weird place with this extraordinary
job lot of people has done you good.  You
will begin to forget soon."
</p>

<p>
Pityingly I smiled at her.
</p>

<p>
"Harry," I told her, "is not the kind of man who
gets forgotten.  I wish he were.  He is one of those
charmers who leave their mark on a woman's life.
He'd such wonderful ways.  He&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't shove me into the wall," begged Elizabeth.
"I feel knocked about enough as it is."
</p>

<p>
"Sorry.  I wish I could make you realize, though,
about Harry.  He once took me to a play where the
woman says: 'There are two kinds of love affairs.
There are affairs&mdash;and there are just
loves.'  Unfortunately this is one of those."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," said Elizabeth drily.
</p>

<p>
"If you'd ever had one of either," said I, nettled,
"you'd know the difference."
</p>

<p>
"So that there will always be one thing that I shall
never know," concluded the Man-hater, limping along.
</p>

<p>
I glanced at the small dog-tired but resolute figure
in the smock that the evening sunlight was gilding from
holland to cloth of gold.
</p>

<p>
"Wait!" I threatened her again.  "Wait until
some great huge ultra-masculine man comes along and
begins to bully you in a voice like a typhoon!"
</p>

<p>
"Like a what?"
</p>

<p>
"Like a gale!  Like a Bull of Basan!  That sort of
huge brute who'd terrify the life out of you, Elizabeth
my child, and order you about like Petruchio and
Katherine in <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>!  That's what'll
happen!  I shall simply love to watch you being
absolutely subjugated"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Book early, to avoid disappointment," mocked my chum.
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;subjugated by a gigantic, navvy sort of person
with muscles as big as vegetable-marrows bobbling all
over his arms and shoulders!"
</p>

<p>
"It sounds too fascinating, doesn't it?" jeered the
girl whose head reached up to my ear.  "I love your
prognostications, Joan, especially after a hard day's
work!  It puts you in train!  You really think a
bully-ragging Prize-fighter-type will be my Fate!"
</p>

<p>
"Unless&mdash;&mdash;"  Here I had another idea.  "Unless
you ever meet the one and only man in this world that
you've ever written letters to.  What about that old
Colonel of yours?" I laughed.
</p>

<p>
A word of explanation here.
</p>

<p>
"The Old Colonel" had been for a year a standing
joke in our London <i>m√©nage</i>.  He was the officer whose
furnished flat we had taken over by the week in Golder's
Green&mdash;and which we'd now left for such very different
quarters.  His flat was full of neat contrivances,
such as the bath-mat, hand-made out of rounds of
bottle corks; full, too, of books on "Tactics," all
annotated in a neat, old-maidish hand.
</p>

<p>
We had amused ourselves by making a mental picture
of their owner&mdash;a methodical, fussy, white-moustached
"old" soldier.  This had seemed all of a
piece, too, with the Colonel's letters; for he and
Elizabeth had exchanged much formal correspondence on
the subjects of the kitchen chimney and of the
tabby-cat he pensioned.
</p>

<p>
"When he comes back from the Front and sees
you," I threatened her, "it may alter everything.
If you become an old man's darling&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Brrrr!" shuddered Elizabeth.
</p>

<p>
"Plenty of girls do.  You might like it better than
marrying the Lion-Tamer, after all....  And don't
say I didn't warn you if it does come off&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Give me your handkerchief," said Elizabeth,
without ceremony plucking the green silk handkerchief
out of my smock pocket.  "I want to tie a knot in
it."
</p>

<p>
She tossed it back to me as we went on.
</p>

<p>
"What's that for?" I demanded.  "To remind
you of what I said about that old Colonel of yours?"
</p>

<p>
"No," from Elizabeth.  "It's to remind you of
something, Joan."
</p>

<p>
As the corrugated iron roof of the hut came into
sight beyond the great white cliff of a hawthorn bush
she spoke earnestly, but with an imp of mischief
dancing in each of her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Whatever happens, however much better you may
feel, however much more you may laugh and talk like
your old self, I want you always to remember one
thing.  I want you to be sure&mdash;sure to go on
thinking of Harry at least once every day!"
</p>

<p>
And before I could take the unsympathetic little
wretch by her overalled shoulders and shake her,
before I could pull her short hair, or even retort by a
single word, we were back at the camp among the
girls&mdash;with a fresh trial awaiting us!

CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
THE PLUNGE
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
"Under the glassy, cool, translucent wave."&mdash;MILTON.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Yes!  Not even yet was there to be rest after
the exertions of the first day's land-work.
</p>

<p>
As Elizabeth and I hobbled into the hut ten
minutes after the others, Vic's voice hailed us above the
laughing clatter:
</p>

<p>
"Here, Celery-face and Mop!  Off with your
spotless&mdash;I don't think&mdash;uniforms, and come on for a
nice swim!"
</p>

<p>
"Swim?" we echoed, glancing aghast about the hut.
</p>

<p>
The gang of timber girls, with Miss Easton, had
returned from their woods, and they and the farm
girls were in various stages of getting out of land-kit
and into swimming costumes.
</p>

<p>
After hard work, here they were all ready again
for hard play, for exercise, for plunging into cold
water.
</p>

<p>
I began to say something wistful about embrocation.
</p>

<p>
"Embrocation?  There's a whole pool of something
better for you than embrocation outside," Vic
said with scorn.  "You get those two extra costumes
out, Sybil, will you?  And you, kids, off with your
boots."
</p>

<p>
There was no gainsaying this redoubtable Vic.
Big, and brown, and beaming with good-humor, she stood
over us.  We just had to start unlacing our gaiters.
</p>

<p>
The girls trooped out into the meadow in coats
over their bathing dresses.  Vic and Sybil waited
inexorably, for us.  Reluctantly and stiffly I took off
my overall.  And I saw Vic's eyes fasten upon the
garments that I was wearing underneath.
</p>

<p>
They were the same "pretties" that I always wore
in town under my georgette blouses.  I made them
myself.  The under-bodice that attracted Vic's notice
was of bluish-pink cr√™pe-de-chine with mauve satin
ribbon shoulder-straps, and with the wings of a
sky-blue bird&mdash;for Happiness&mdash;embroidered across the
front.
</p>

<p>
"That's a dinky 'casserole' you've got on there,
young Celery-face," pronounced Vic, scrutinizing this
garment.  "Swanky Royal Air Service crest touch!
And a silk 'chim' underneath it, too!  My word!
You won't be wearing those things long on the farm,
though.  Look here, Syb!"
</p>

<p>
Sybil, who had brought out the spare costumes,
came up.  From her voice and ways I'd fancied that
she would sympathize with my own idea of dressing
for the Land.  This was to make it a point of
self-respect that, though I must wear coarse holland and
rough stuff for my outside things, my under-garments
should still be as dainty as ever.
</p>

<p>
It surprised me when Sybil, glancing at my
underthings, shook her head deprecatingly.
</p>

<p>
"Those won't do," she told me gently.  "Not for
cleaning out cow-houses in!  You don't find a
man-worker&mdash;well!" she laughed, "you never find a man
wearing pink cr√™pe-de-chine all day.  But what I
mean is that when you're on a man's job you've got
to dress the part, not just for the look of it, but for
the use.  A man works 'in the sweat of his brow'&mdash;and
of his body.  So he has got to have clothes he can
sweat into comfortably&mdash;to put it frankly.  He
doesn't wear things that hold the moisture and
cling&mdash;as yours are doing now."
</p>

<p>
I glanced down.  The crepe and ribbons certainly
were clinging to me.  Moreover, they were very chilly
now I'd stopped moving about.
</p>

<p>
"Give you your death of cold, those would," Vic
declared, and Sybil, wrapping a towel round my
shoulders, supported her.
</p>

<p>
"Working as a man, you simply can't wear the
clothes you wore when you were just sitting still as
a girl!" she remarked.
</p>

<p>
"I can't wear woollies and sweaters next me," I
protested.  "I would rather die of cold!"
</p>

<p>
"You needn't wear wool," Sybil said, as I got stiffly
into my costume.  "Though of course athletes say
a sweater next your skin is the only thing.  They do
scoff at the way women wear four thicknesses of silk
or lace, and then a 'sweater' over it all, doing no good!
But you must wear a woven vest or one of linen
mesh&mdash;or anything that dries quickly, and lets the
air through to your skin.  I'll lend you something,
then you can order more."
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "And keep dinky undies<br>
  For civvies and Sundays,"<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
sang out Vic.  "Now then, ready?"
</p>

<p>
Vic caught each of us by an arm, and ran us out
of hut and home, down the green and daisied meadow
at the back of the camp.
</p>

<p>
In front of us two girls, with bare legs showing
under their ballooning Land Army coats, and a third
swathed round with a bath-robe, were gambolling
like lambs down the grassy path.  From behind the
alders at the bottom came sounds of splashing and
laughter.  We followed to where the bank descended
under trees to the Welsh trout-stream, brightly clear
as a child's eyes, with little cataracts between mossy
boulders from which the girls could dive into the wide,
smooth pool that reflected them.
</p>

<p>
Well!  It was all the bathroom the camp had.  We
might as well get in and treat it as a good wash!
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth, on the pool brink, said:
</p>

<p>
"N&mdash;neither of us can swim, you know&mdash;oooh!"
she wound up with her little screech.  Vic, gently, but
firmly, had shoved her under water.
</p>

<p>
I dipped before she could catch hold of me, while
the others shouted with laughter.  The first moment
was awful.  Then came the glorious glow and tingle
of reaction, and we felt quite jolly, as Vic promised
that she and young Sybil would soon teach us to swim.
</p>

<p>
"In and out with you today, though," she decreed.
"Here's the towel&mdash;have a scrub now.  I'll
rub you down."
</p>

<p>
Scarified but warm enough, we sat under an alder
in our overcoats, watching the others until tea-time
or supper-time as we cared to call it.  And then&mdash;Ah!
It was as though one substantial midday meal
had never been....
</p>

<p>
We just legged it ("for the best!" as the Timber
girls shouted) back to the mess-table in the Hut!

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br><br>
OUR MESS-MATES
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Whence came ye, merry Damsels, whence came ye,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many, and so many, and such glee?"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;KEATS.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Later Elizabeth and I talked to Miss Easton,
who, while the Campites played, read, sewed, or
danced as before, told us a little about them
all&mdash;these girls, who were already less strange to us,
and who were all to become our friends.
</p>

<p>
Miss Easton began with her own story.  Her last
job had been in a munitions factory, where she'd
worked ten hours a day on a skeleton bridge 35 feet up
in the air, which had danced and quivered with the
heat of a row of furnaces below.  She said it always
felt like Vesuvius going to break into eruption.  Not
unnaturally her health had broken down.
</p>

<p>
At the Labour Exchange she had mentioned "Forestry"
as a forlorn hope, and they'd given her a
trial&mdash;in more senses than one.
</p>

<p>
She had been set to cross-cut sawing with a
hardened "old hand."  Twenty-five trees was counted a
day's work.  Halfway through the twenty-third she
had fainted clean off.  For a week she'd crept back
to her billet, and had just taken her aches and blisters
to bed, where she lay like a log until the next morning.
Now she could stand anything&mdash;climb like a cat or
run like a deer.
</p>

<p>
"I feel finer every day," she told us, smiling.
</p>

<p>
Then she told us of the others, in order of what
used to be called "Social Importance."  I suppose
Sybil Wentworth came first.  She was the country-house
girl, who had only known London as the Season,
the Park, Hurlingham and Henley.  Her own home
was lovely, Miss Easton said; there was Georgian wing
and a Norman chapel, and it boasted one of those
other countless bedrooms where Queen Elizabeth had
passed a night.
</p>

<p>
Now Sybil's mattress was drawn up next to Lil's,
who had been maid-of-all-work in one of the million
villas that are too small to house and feed a servant
decently, but where a servant must be kept because
one is kept in bigger houses.
</p>

<p>
Among Lil's mates were a girl from Somerville, a
pickle-factory hand, a student of music, and Vic the
Cockney.
</p>

<p>
In every community of girls is one who will always
take the lead by virtue of her vitality and initiative.
Here it was Victoria Jelks, the ex-coster girl from
Kentish Town, who stood out as one of the handsomest,
"goeyest," and most efficient women I have
met.
</p>

<p>
The forewoman took Vic's advice; Sybil deferred
to her.  Yet she belonged to the class that we have
seen blackening Hampstead Heath on Bank Holidays,
grimy and an√¶mic, made ugly by the life and toil of
town.  The country, the air, the healthy work have
beautified them back into the mould that Nature meant;
have given them back shapeliness and colour.
</p>

<p>
I pondered over the miracle, as I saw it now.
</p>

<p>
For these once-town girls, too, the two great drawbacks
of the country did not exist.  Dulness, loneliness!
How could they feel lonely or bored leading this
communal life all set to laughter?  No wonder if they
found it like the very best bits of being back at school
again!  With fewer restrictions, too, with what wealth
of new ideas, fresh outlooks on life gained by the
intermingling of class with class....
</p>

<p>
Kitchener's First Army was not more of a medley
of types!
</p>

<p>
"Why," Elizabeth asked softly, "have they all
joined up?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Different reasons they give," answered the
forewoman.  "One joins because her pal joined.  Lil
there was tired of domestic service&mdash;I'm sure I don't
blame her.  Another hears what fun the life is&mdash;and
it is fun, even if we do have to work hard.  We
couldn't work so hard if it weren't fun!  Another
thinks it's a shame if we can't do as much as the
Frenchwomen do.  Another girl just said, 'I've got
six brothers serving.'"
</p>

<p>
Here a lump came into my throat as I listened.
I thought of my own brothers.  Jack, who went down
with his ship in '15&mdash;Guy with his guns&mdash;Victor,
the youngest of us all, who had just got his wings,
and was off to join his air squadron in France.  What
sort of sister was I to those fighting boys?
Unworthy!  Poor in physique and grit, I'd been ready
to buy myself out of the Land Army almost before
I'd given it a trial.
</p>

<p>
I was still thinking of that after "Lights out,"
when all the girls were already asleep.
</p>

<p>
But Elizabeth, from the next mattress, heard.
</p>

<p>
She crept near in the darkness.
</p>

<p>
"Joan!  What is it?  Why are you crying?"
she whispered.  "Are you cross because I teased you
about that wretched Harry?"
</p>

<p>
"No!  Oh, no," I whispered back.  "It's only that
I&mdash;I felt ashamed of myself!  There was I&mdash;ready
to jack up this morning!  I won't now.  No, not if
I never stop feeling stiff again, I shall stick it.  I've
just made up my mind this minute."
</p>

<p>
"You made it up before," murmured my chum,
wriggling back to her mattress.  "You made it up
this morning when that young man said&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, bother that interfering young man," I
interrupted, "I hope I don't see him again."
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth, as she rolled over again, said drowsily
but firmly, "You'll see him again before three days
are up."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br><br>
THE MILKING-LESSON
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
"I would I were a milkmaid."&mdash;TENNYSON.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Elizabeth was right in her prediction.
Before the three next days were up I had
again encountered this Captain Holiday.
</p>

<p>
This time it was not in that Augean stable of a
cow-house&mdash;which, by the way, I had finished
cleaning out&mdash;thereby earning a word of approbation
from Mr. Price, and also hardening my muscles.  I
no longer felt that my body was full of new bones, all
hurting me at once.  I felt, already, as if I were
gaining a new body.
</p>

<p>
Quite ready for anything I felt on that late afternoon
when Mrs. Price came to me with the two big
milk pails.
</p>

<p>
"Please scald these out," said the farmer's
daintily-featured little wife.  "You can take your first
milking-lesson this evening."
</p>

<p>
I was delighted as I washed my hands in the back
kitchen, scalded out the pails, and followed Mrs. Price
in her crisp grey overall into the big cow stall.
</p>

<p>
Milking!  This would be so much easier, as well as
more enjoyable, than wielding that pitchfork and
bending my back over that heavy barrow to and from
that disgusting midden!
</p>

<p>
How fragrant, after that last job, was the atmosphere
of the big stable, where the breath of the cows
mingled with the incomparable smell of the new milk
that was already frothing and foaming into the pail
held between the knees of the Land Girl "Curley"&mdash;that
straight-haired, smiling brunette.
</p>

<p>
She was sitting milking the biggest of the seven
black-and-white cows that stood tied up in a row.
At the stall next to her sat Sybil on a three-legged
stool of heavy oak, also milking busily.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Joan, you shall start away on Clover here.
She's the easiest," said Mrs. Price, leading me to a
cow at the farther end of the stable&mdash;a cow that was
snowy white but for the broad band of black that
encircled her body and the black tassel of her tail.
</p>

<p>
The farmer's wife took that tail in her hand and
with a twist of straw-rope tied it down to one of the
cow's hind-legs.
</p>

<p>
"That is to stop her flicking you in the eye with
it," explained Mrs. Price.  "Now Vic always puts
the tail to the cow's side and pins it down by leaning
her head against it; but you can't manage that yet.
Always nervous they are at first, with a stranger.
Soon get used to you," Mrs. Price assured me, as
the cow looked round, tossed her head, shuffled her
little hoofs, and would have twitched that captive tail.
"I'll talk to her a little."
</p>

<p>
Fondling her silky flanks, the farmer's wife spoke to
Clover, in soothing, softly-accented words that I
suppose were Greek to Curley and Sybil&mdash;but I still
remembered a little of the language that had been
chattered about me in those far-off school-room days, when
I'd worn a plait and wandered about a Welsh farm,
so differently run from this one.
</p>

<p>
I'd seen Dad's cowman stand to milk on the steep
hillside, where the cows grazed.  He had called to his
cows just like this.
</p>

<p>
"Little heart!" cooed Mrs. Price, in Welsh.
"Heart of gold!  Best white sugar, you are!  Little
Clover, dear!  I'll start her, Joan."
</p>

<p>
She set the wide-lipped pail under the cow, and
with that other small, capable hand of hers began
milking where she stood.  Sharply and copiously the
white spurts ran through her fingers.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Joan," she said in a moment.  "Sit down
to it.  Take your pail so.  Now your fingers like
this.  Now try."
</p>

<p>
I tried.
</p>

<p>
Once or twice I'd been allowed to try at home, long
ago.  But how I'd forgotten!
</p>

<p>
Heavens!  How difficult it was!  If Clover were
the easiest cow in that stable, I should have been sorry
to try the most unyielding one!  It was almost
impossible to me at first to squeeze out even a drop of
milk.
</p>

<p>
I worked away, and quite suddenly I realized that
it was coming mightily hard on my fingers and
forearms, this work that seemed to be no work at all to
Mrs. Price, and easy enough to the two other girls.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know how long it takes to make a milker,
a really first-class milker?  Three years," declared
the farmer's wife impressively.  "And even then she
has to be born as well as made, like.  After all, it's
an art, same as playing the piano.  But you can learn
to milk quite well, quite so that the cows get milked
all right, in a month, say.  You'll do all right, only
work."
</p>

<p>
I worked without much success, but doggedly.  I
was sweating with effort under my hat and into my
mesh garments, lent by Sybil.  I was flushed, but
determined; terrified of hurting Clover, delighted when
a meagre spurt of milk did reward me, attentive to
Mrs. Price's instructions, and afraid I was showing
myself up as the completest fool, when&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Yes, this naturally was the moment that that young
man's voice made itself heard behind me.  He must
have come in by the other door farther down the
stable.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, Mrs. Price!"
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, Captain Holiday.  Have you come
to have another look round?"
</p>

<p>
"You don't mind, I know," said the direct,
uncompromising tone, which I could guess was
accompanied by that friendly and ingratiating smile.
</p>

<p>
Intent upon my occupation, I went on struggling.
My back was to him; but there are times when one
can feel a pair of eyes fixed as surely as one could
feel a hand placed on the nape of one's neck.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Now, looking back, I wonder at myself.
</p>

<p>
Was there really that time when I never wished to
see him?  Was he still nothing to me, then?  It seems
incredible to me, after all that has come since.
</p>

<p>
But, that late afternoon, all in the fragrant atmosphere
of the milk that rang in the pails, with the sweet
grass-scented breath of the cows all about me, he was
nothing to me, nothing still but an intruder.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
With a sigh of exasperation I tugged at the warm,
leathery udder of Clover.  Strenuous minutes elapsed.
Still Captain Holiday stood by, saying no word to
me, but always watching.
</p>

<p>
Always conscious of his presence, I saw nothing of
him but his shadow flung before him, clean-cut blue
on the yellow-white wall of the stable.
</p>

<p>
Then I heard Mrs. Price asking him if he were
comfortable at the lodge?
</p>

<p>
So that was where he lived; Vic had told me there
was quite a swanky big lodge to the hospital grounds.
</p>

<p>
He told Mrs. Price that they were very nice
quarters.  Then came something I hadn't expected.  I
heard Mrs. Price give a curiously mischievous little
chuckle.  It ran through her voice as she asked the
next question:
</p>

<p>
"More than enough room there, isn't there, Captain
Holiday, for a bachelor?"
</p>

<p>
This was a hint, I know, smiling and plainly meant!
Not only that, but I felt her smile taking in myself
as well as him.
</p>

<p>
She was as bad as Elizabeth.  I was glad my back
was towards both of them.
</p>

<p>
Captain Holiday's cool voice replied:
</p>

<p>
"Quite.  That's why I'm having some people down
to stay with me.  Must have a house-party for the
concert.  You know we're getting up a concert at
the hospital, Mrs. Price.  Yes, I'm expecting a
wounded pal of mine down in a day or so."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Price's soft voice broke in to speak to me.
</p>

<p>
"Tired, Joan?  Rest a minute, just&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I moved into a more comfortable position, giving
a look round before I bent to my task again.
</p>

<p>
The young "Must-know-all," as the nursery phrase
has it, was still watching my fingers.  What was it in
his slight smile that seemed to prompt me to what I
did next?
</p>

<p>
I squeezed some milk on to my fingers, and then,
I know, his smile grew broader.  It was as though
he'd seen that old trick somewhere, and had egged me
on to it.  But where had this soldier watched milking
before?
</p>

<p>
"That's coming better now, Joan," approved
Mrs. Price.  "That's because you wetted your fingers.
Look&mdash;dip your fingers in the milk, my mother taught
me.  Easier for the cow and easier for you."
</p>

<p>
I said:
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I remember now seeing the man dip his fingers
in the pail at Dad's farm.  I'd forgotten.  Lots of
things will come back to me presently."
</p>

<p>
Here, above me, the man's shadow moved quickly
on the wall.  It was as though Captain Holiday, still
planted there behind me, were listening as intently as
he was watching me.
</p>

<p>
Rather confused, I went on to show that I did know
something about this job.
</p>

<p>
"I saw on the efficiency test papers," said I, "that
the examiners from headquarters don't like the wet
milking.  It said preference would be given to dry
milking."
</p>

<p>
"Cleaner, for some, p'raps," said Mrs. Price.
"Fifteen marks, too; but I thought you were no town
girl!  Doesn't it show now, Captain Holiday?"
</p>

<p>
A non-committal "Um" came from Captain Holiday
as his tall shadow slid away from the wall and
out of the farmyard just as Elizabeth and Vic came
in.
</p>

<p>
"Again!" was my chum's laconic comment when we
were walking home.
</p>

<p>
I laughed good-humouredly enough, for I was a little
pleased with the way I'd got on with my work.
</p>

<p>
"Elizabeth, you're getting one-idea'ed," I told her
as I strolled along, picking out of the hedge a country
nosegay of stitchwort and dog-violets and primroses
with one gay pink flower of campion.  "I must say
I shall be glad when Hackenschmidt the Second turns
up&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Who?"
</p>

<p>
"The hefty Brute who's going to tame you, you
Man-hater, when the time comes," I explained, putting
a leaf of Herb-Robert, pungent-scented and lacy, as
frill to my bouquet.  "I shall be able to rag you about
him then, instead of having to put up with your
nonsense.  You wait."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'm waiting," nodded Elizabeth grimly.
</p>

<p>
I said "All things come to her who waits.  I expect
he'll take at <i>least</i> seventeens in boots!  And throw
them at you!"

CHAPTER XI
<br><br>
THE LAND-GIRLS' LETTER-BAG
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
"A word in due season, how good it is!"&mdash;SCRIPTURE.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
At the Camp we found the Timber-gang buzzing
about what constituted for all of us the great
event of the day&mdash;the day's mail.
</p>

<p>
It arrived after the girls were already at work, so
that since breakfast they had been looking forward to
the letters, wondering about them....
</p>

<p>
Ah, these letters!  Most people realize by this time
how much they have always meant to the boys at the
Front.  They meant as much and more to the war-working
girls!  You people who "can't be bothered to
write much," you correspondents who "forget"&mdash;I
wish you could have seen that group of uniformed
lasses with the green Forestry ribbons round their hats,
clustering about the forewoman who held the packet.
I wish you could have heard the eager tone of their
"Any for me?"
</p>

<p>
"Two for you, Curley&mdash;one from France.  Oh! girls,
look at the snapshots of me sister's nippers.
'To Auntie Vic, with love from Stan'&mdash;all right, ain't
it?" cried Vic.
</p>

<p>
"Only these four for me?" exclaimed the red-haired
Welsh timber girl.
</p>

<p>
"And none for me!  Isn't it a cruel shame?"
lamented Lil.  "Here, Aggie, do let me have a read of
yours&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I say, this isn't for me.  It got slipped in among
mine.  'Miss Weare'&mdash;who's she when she's at home?
Oh!  The little new one.  Here, Mop&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth took the letter.
</p>

<p>
I was reading a kind letter from Agatha, my
step-mother, who ended with, "Still I hope you will not
find that this new venture of yours is a mistake after
all," when there was a little sudden laugh and a quick
exclamation from my chum at my elbow.
</p>

<p>
"Joan, I say, Joan!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes?  Who've you heard from?"
</p>

<p>
"Who d'you think?" she returned amusedly, taking
me by the elbow to draw me aside into the porch.
"I'll give you three guesses!"
</p>

<p>
"Man or woman?  Ah, I needn't ask.  Woman, of
course?"
</p>

<p>
"As it happens, no!"
</p>

<p>
"What?  A man?" I exclaimed.  "But you never
write to any men&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't I?  I do."
</p>

<p>
"Only to one landlord," I said.  "Only to the ancient
Colonel!"
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth gave her gurgling boyish chuckle.
</p>

<p>
"Right in one," she said.  "It is the old Colonel
again.  You know I wrote to him last about that loose
scullery tap that we had to leave as it was.  Well, he's
home on sick leave now, he says, and he writes from
our flat&mdash;his own flat, I mean.  Only he's coming
down here very shortly&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Here?" I exclaimed, glancing round the big hut,
with its characteristic grouping of Land Girls off
duty.
</p>

<p>
Some of them were still poring and chattering over
their mail; Peggy, with her foot upon a chair, was
cleaning her hobnailed boots; Vic, now clad in a
bathing costume and her Land Army hat, was sitting
on a corner of the table, swinging her legs, whistling,
and stitching at a button that had come loose on her
khaki breeches.
</p>

<p>
"This is no place for a dear old gentleman like your
colonel!  What does he want to come here for?" I
added.
</p>

<p>
"Says he'll be staying with a friend of his in this
neighbourhood," explained Elizabeth, handing me the
note with the neat, precise handwriting that we had
seen on so many business letters, "and that as I was
here he would give himself the pleasure of calling upon
me if he might.  Antediluvian touch, isn't it?  And,
of course, he won't be allowed to call here, I suppose,
even at his age."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but I hope we shall meet him," I said, as I
prepared to get into bathing-things again for my
swimming lesson from Vic and Sybil in the pool.  "It
will be rather fun, after all our guess-work, to see
what the funny old thing really is like."
</p>

<p>
Now this was vouchsafed to us in a few days from
then.  And I admit that this, and what it brought in
its train, has been quite one of the shocks of my
life.

CHAPTER XII
<br><br>
WE "GET USED TO IT "
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "This is the life,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the life,<br>
  This is the life&mdash;for mine!"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;THE BING BOYS.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
We had been at Mr. Price's farm for a week
now.  In that short time the miracle had
begun to work.
</p>

<p>
Seven bottles of the most powerful pick-me-up could
not have worked in that time what was done by these
seven natural tonics&mdash;fresh air, physical toil, simple,
wholesome food, cold water, newness of occupation,
laughter with comradeship, and profound sleep
o' nights!
</p>

<p>
"This is pretty awful, you know," we whispered
rebelliously to each other half a dozen times a day.
</p>

<p>
But&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Already we were beginning to enjoy it all!  Neither
of us admitted this, of course.  For my part, I should
have felt it was too ridiculously soon to enjoy anything
in life again&mdash;and such a life!
</p>

<p>
That rag-time rabble of girls!  That lack of
civilized comforts in camp!  Vic's orders for the day!
This routine of jobs only fit for a farm-lad&mdash;yet
what thrills of pride ran through me at the thought
that I, Joan Matthews, was doing them at all, and
that soon I should begin to do them quite well!
</p>

<p>
I had cleaned out a hopelessly filthy-looking
cow-house&mdash;thrill of pride number one&mdash;all by
myself&mdash;nearly.  No rush of work accomplished at the office
had ever given me such satisfaction!  Then I'd taken
three milking lessons, at the first of which Mrs. Price
said I'd made a good start&mdash;thrill number two.  Now
Mr. Price had set me and my chum on to a new
job&mdash;thrill number three&mdash;in which he was instructing us
himself.
</p>

<p>
This was to harness his old white mare, Blossom,
to the cart, to take it down to the field of roots across
the road from the farm, and to fork up roots, which
we were presently to pulp into food for the bullocks,
which were still being partly stable-fed each day.
</p>

<p>
Into that big field, bordered by elms, through which
we caught glimpses of a faintly purple range of
mountains, Elizabeth and I tramped with the farmer;
she at Blossom's mild head, I carrying a fork and
listening to that gentle giant, Mr. Price.
</p>

<p>
"When we have got a cart-load I will take you
to the grinding-machine and show you how you mash
these things up," he told me.  "Very handy, the new
power-engine!  Three belts for shafting I've got
from the engine to the machine.  Put it in this winter,
I did.  All done by horse-power before that.  Wonderful!
What they're getting to do now in the farms!
Wouldn't have believed it in my father's time&mdash;no, nor
that I should have little young ladies like that one to
lead the horses for me," he smiled.  "Stop her here,
missy.  Whoa, back!  It's up here we'll start."
</p>

<p>
But before Elizabeth had left the horse's head,
before I'd dug my fork more than once into the
rich-smelling earth, a "Good morning" sounded behind us,
in a deep but gentle voice.
</p>

<p>
We turned, I saying resignedly to myself in that
flash:
</p>

<p>
"I suppose it's Captain Holiday again&mdash;sounds as
meek as Moses for once, but he's evidently come to see
how the Land Girls get on with their root-digging,
and to tell them all about it."
</p>

<p>
And I found that I was wrong.
</p>

<p>
The young man who'd been tramping up that field
behind us was not Captain Holiday, though he wore
khaki and leggings like his.
</p>

<p>
"Er&mdash;&mdash;" he began with a hand to his cap, and
obviously not sure whether he ought to speak first to
the farmer or to me.  "I&mdash;er&mdash;saw you from the
road there.  If you don't mind, aren't
you"&mdash;nervously&mdash;"aren't you the two ladies from London?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said, standing there rather astonished.
</p>

<p>
The young officer went on with his eyes on the cart,
that shut out any view of Elizabeth.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes.  I hope you don't mind, but I thought
I'd come up and&mdash;er&mdash;speak&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
At that moment I thought I had never in my life
seen anybody so agonizingly timid.  Gazing at the
D.S.O. ribbon on his chest, I could only wonder if he
had won it whilst he was in a high fever and did not
know what he was doing....  Miserably shy, too, he
looked to me.
</p>

<p>
But he didn't go away.  He went on talking, though
stammeringly.
</p>

<p>
"You know, I know you both quite well&mdash;I mean
by name, of course.  We've&mdash;we've exchanged plenty
of letters and all that," he went on stammeringly.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid it's a mistake," I began.
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;er&mdash;no," he interrupted.  "I'd better tell
you who I am&mdash;stupid of me.  I'm&mdash;er&mdash;my name
is Fielding.  Colonel Fielding."
</p>

<p>
Colonel Fielding!&mdash;Fielding?
</p>

<p>
But that was the name of our landlord!  That was
the officer from whom we'd taken over our Golder's
Green flat!
</p>

<p>
How we'd talked and talked over the fancy picture
that we had made up of him&mdash;the white-moustached
old warrior of a bygone age, as we had imagined
him!
</p>

<p>
Now, here he stood before us&mdash;and could anything
be less like our preconceived view of him?
</p>

<p>
Colonel Fielding in the flesh was a young man of
twenty-six, slim-waisted and fair.  The white moustache
of our imaginings was represented by the merest
hint of close-cropped golden down upon his upper lip.
</p>

<p>
I could hardly believe it.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean," I exclaimed, "that you are really
the Colonel Fielding who let us his flat?"
</p>

<p>
"Er&mdash;yes.  I am."  He reddened, actually reddened
all over his face as he cleared his throat and
added, "Do you mind telling me&mdash;are you Miss
Elizabeth Weare?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm Miss Matthews," I told him.  "That's
Miss Weare&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
For it was at this moment that Blossom dragged the
cart a step forward, and Elizabeth, calling manfully.
"Whoa-back!" in imitation of Mr. Price, reached up
to her head again, and pulled her round.
</p>

<p>
I suppose to the end of his days one man will see
Elizabeth as she was at that moment in the field of
roots.
</p>

<p>
It was a colourful and blowy day.  The sky, threatening
rain, showed capricious clouds, dove-grey and
silver-white, tossing across the blue.  A mauve screen
of Welsh hills, a nearer fringe of budding elms
bordered that big field of lush brown-and-purply-green.
Set in the middle of it like a giant's toy was the
scarlet-painted farm-cart with the white mare; a small, boyish,
crop-haired, smocked and breeched Land-girl at her
head.
</p>

<p>
Colour and sunburn suited my chum's small face.
The Land Army hat had been drenched by several
showers to a becoming softness over her thick hair.
She held herself (even in those early days of freedom
from skirts) with a new poise.  She was as effective as
any poster in the Tube! but with no Tube atmosphere
about her; no! the strong scents of earth, the wine-sweet
breath of Spring wind that tossed the black locks
on her rosied cheeks, and flapped in her smock, billowing
it out below her belt or furling it above her
legs&mdash;her legs which were at once sturdy and dainty.
Briefly, she looked ripping.  And I saw that Colonel
Fielding saw it even in that first moment of his
greeting her.
</p>

<p>
It was not much more than a greeting and a good-bye;
a word to the farmer about "hoping he didn't
mind"&mdash;which would appear to be the youthful
colonel's pet stand-by of a phrase.
</p>

<p>
"Er&mdash;I might be down for some time probably,"
he concluded, reddening again.  "Perhaps I might be
allowed to call?"
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth, without looking at him, answered in a
tone like the shutting of a door:
</p>

<p>
"We live in camp here.  Men aren't allowed there."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;sorry.  I hope you didn't mind.  Perhaps,"
he added&mdash;faint but pursuing&mdash;"I shall see
you again&mdash;er&mdash;somewhere&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth, stony little wretch, said nothing at all.
I think I began to say "Are you staying at Careg?"
out of sheer pity, but it was Mr. Price, the gentle
Welsh giant, who broke in:
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sure!  Any time you like to see over the
farm!  I'll show you our shire horses!  Interest you,
those would.  You shall come round with me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thanks.  I should love to," murmured Colonel
Fielding, with one last glance at my chum before he
melted away out of the landscape.
</p>

<p>
Even as he did so, I saw the expression on that fair,
girlish face of the man we'd always nicknamed
"Elizabeth's Old Colonel."  He was unmistakably,
unfeignedly admiring.  It made him show, for a second, quite
a determined gleam between his long lashes.
</p>

<p>
But what a waste of time for him to admire Elizabeth&mdash;at
least if he tried to show it!  He was, anyhow,
not the sort of person, I decided, that any girl would
fall in love with!
</p>

<p>
Finnicky, I called him.  I said so afterwards to
Elizabeth.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth said she was so busy with the horse she
hadn't had time to see what he was like.
</p>

<p>
Then (as I should have told you) we forgot all about
that encounter in the root-field.
</p>

<p>
For three days we lived the Life Laborious; busy
and full, but empty of all young men.  Not a glimpse
of one.
</p>

<p>
Then, one evening down at the swimming-pool, I said
to Elizabeth, sitting on a mossy boulder and waiting
for Vic to come up:
</p>

<p>
"Do you know we've been here for three weeks
now?  I feel as if we had been Land Girls all our lives.
But the last week has been the quickest&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;And the jolliest!" interrupted my chum.
</p>

<p>
Then we both burst out laughing together.
</p>

<p>
Pretence was at an end.  We agreed that we were
simply loving the life and the people, the work and
the play.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br>
<i>We agreed that we were simply loving the life and the <br>
people, the work and the play</i>
</p>

<p>
As for me, I was such a different girl.  I hadn't time
to think about how different.
</p>

<p>
"Ready, Celery-face?" sang out Vic, striding
from behind the alder where she'd flung off her coat.
</p>

<p>
A group of girls watched her&mdash;the former star of
a London swimming-bath&mdash;as she took her plunge into
the pool.
</p>

<p>
Then I waded in after her, and, all awkwardly still,
swam the dozen strokes that brought me up to her.
Panting, I held on to her.  An absurdly short little
effort&mdash;but it was the taste of a new function to me,
the beginner.  What years I'd wasted in not knowing
how to swim!  But oh, the joy of it now!
</p>

<p>
I looked round to see Elizabeth striking out with
arms that were, like mine, milky-white to the elbow
and then gloved in sunburn.
</p>

<p>
For by now I must tell you we had got our "Land
Girl's complexion."  This asset is gained in three
distinct stages.
</p>

<p>
First stage: A scorching and very unbecoming scarlet
that spread itself over the face.  The recruit from
town, seeing herself with a tomato-nose set between
crimson cheeks, flies to her old and true friend, the
powder-puff.  Useless!  To powder over that red is
like putting a coat of transparent whitewash over a
brick wall.
</p>

<p>
The second stage: Soreness and blisters; a skin
that peels off in flakes like the bark of a silver birch.
No help for this!  Sybil had given me cucumber and
benzoin lotion to cool the smart, but the only cure
was that which time brought about.
</p>

<p>
Stage the third: A smooth, even wash of honey-tan
over the newly-bloomed roses of the cheeks; the colour
of the ripe glow on a sun-kissed peach.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth had reached this becoming stage on the
day that Colonel Fielding had seen her first at the
white mare's head in the field of roots, and I was
scarcely a day behind her.  I laughed at the reflection
in the pool of the girl whom Vic and the others still
nicknamed "Celery-face!"
</p>

<p>
Rosier than ever after our swim, we dressed and
strolled together down the lanes.  For "the more you
have of a thing the more you want it" applies to fresh
air as well as to the other essentials of life.
</p>

<p>
Now that we were working out of doors all day,
we found we wanted to stay out of doors in the
evening!  How unlike town, where, having worked all day
in a stuffy office, our one idea of relaxation was an
equally stuffy theatre!
</p>

<p>
But I did sometimes miss the theatre!  Upon this
very evening I said to Elizabeth:
</p>

<p>
"The birds are lovely tonight&mdash;listen!  But do
you know what?  I would give anything to be going
to a revue tonight; just to see some pretty girls'
clothes after these weeks of felt hats and breeches!
Just to hear some gay tunes from a good band!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," agreed Elizabeth, quite dreamily for her.
"I would like to hear a little music again just for
once.  I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Who's saying they want to hear a little music?"  It
was a merry girl's voice that broke upon our ears.
"Here's where dreams come true!"

CHAPTER XIII
<br><br>
AN INVITATION
</h3>

<p>
We looked to the right.  On a gate in the
blossoming hedge sat the tiny Timber-girl
Peggy, she who in the evening always wore
a flower pinned by a badge to the breast of her
crisply-ironed smock.  This evening it was a spray of
honeysuckle.
</p>

<p>
Beside her, leaning his elbows on the gate, stood a
blue-suited young soldier from the hospital; he also
wore a large spray of honeysuckle in his button-hole,
and another in his khaki cap, which was further
decorated by a lucky gollywog in pink and green wool!
He touched it smiling as we paused beside our little
comrade.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, talking of music, girls," said Peggy, "look
what my boy's got for you, for all of us!  Show them,
Syd."
</p>

<p>
Syd, who was a sergeant, and had the cheerfullest
pink face I have ever seen above a blue jacket, thrust
his hand into the pocket of that jacket, and brought
out a large envelope which he handed to me.  It was
unaddressed and open.  I took out a sort of illuminated
card; its border showed floral designs, a rising
sun, black cats, and several regimental crests.  In
curliest copperplate there was written:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  <span class="smcap">To the Lady Land-Workers,<br>
  Careg Camp.</span><br>
  You are invited to a<br>
  GRAND CONCERT,<br>
  to be held at<br>
  THE CAREG AUXILIARY RED CROSS HOSPITAL,<br>
  on the night of June 10.<br>
  To commence at<br>
  7 pip emma<br>
  (<i>Tanks and bi-planes at 9.45.</i>)<br>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
"How lovely!" I exclaimed, handing this card back
to Peggy.  "I heard something about there being a
concert at the hospital, but I never knew we were to
be asked."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, miss," said Sergeant "Syd" in a husky, boyish
voice.  "Captain Holiday himself said the invitation
was to go to the camp in good time, so that all
of the young ladies might arrange to come.  He hoped
all of you would, of course."
</p>

<p>
"Tell him not to worry, we're all for it," declared
saucy little Peggy from her gate.  "I daresay it'll
be a wash-out of a concert"&mdash;with a wink at us&mdash;"but
we'll have to be thankful for what we can get
in the Land Army.  I suppose you'll give us a solo on
the comb?  And is your Captain Holiday going to
oblige at the concert, Syd?"
</p>

<p>
"Not him!  Says he doesn't know one tune from
another," laughed the wounded soldier.  "Sitting in
the audience with you young ladies, that's the job
he's for."
</p>

<p>
"I'm astonished at him," said Peggy, with a
mischievous smile straight at me.
</p>

<p>
Syd added:
</p>

<p>
"I tell you who is a very fine singer, now&mdash;we
could listen to him all night&mdash;his voice is a fair treat,
and he's going to sing.  It's that officer that Captain
Holiday's got staying at the Lodge with him.  Colonel
Fielding, his name is."
</p>

<p>
I exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  So he's staying at the Lodge!"
</p>

<p>
Peggy gave me a quick look and said:
</p>

<p>
"So he's another friend of yours?"
</p>

<p>
"No," I explained.  "We've just met him."  Then,
thinking it would be silly to make any mystery about
all this, I explained about Colonel Fielding being our
landlord in London, and I mentioned the business
letters about breakages and drains.
</p>

<p>
"And we're to hear him sing, are we?" I
concluded&mdash;and again Sergeant Syd enlarged upon what
a treat it would be for anybody who liked good music.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but I don't know anything about 'good'
music," said Elizabeth, carelessly.
</p>

<p>
We went on, leaving that picturesque group of
Land-girl and soldier by that gate in the hedge.
</p>

<p>
Presently I found myself thinking of the way Colonel
Fielding's delicate fair face had lighted up at the
sight of Elizabeth, sturdy and muddy and sweet, in
the mangold-field.
</p>

<p>
How obviously he had admired that sight!
</p>

<p>
He was probably looking forward to seeing it again.
Poor wretched young man!  For if he imagined that
my boyish, independent, man-hating little chum would
have a word for him at that concert&mdash;whatever he
sang like&mdash;a bitter disappointment was in store for
him, thought I.  I had seen Elizabeth before, when
men had been attracted.  Prickly as a hedgehog she
had become in the twinkling of an eye!
</p>

<p>
While I was thus musing, she was gazing above the
hedge at the hills in the gloaming, purple against a
primrose belt of sky.  A heavenly evening!  No wonder
Elizabeth wanted to drink in the beauty of country
and sky rather than to talk.  I felt as she did.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Elizabeth spoke, in a matter of fact tone
that sounded as if she had just dragged herself back
into the life of every day.
</p>

<p>
"That concert," she said, "won't be bad fun."
</p>

<p>
"I expect it will be ripping," I agreed, as we took
the turning that led us back by a roundabout way to
the camp again.  "Wasn't that invitation-card for it
rather sweet?  You know he'd painted all those crests
and flowers and things himself."
</p>

<p>
"He did?" said Elizabeth, "he or Captain Holiday,
d'you mean?"
</p>

<p>
I turned to her a little puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Holiday&mdash;or who?" I said.
</p>

<p>
Quickly Elizabeth slipped out&mdash;"or Colonel Fielding,
of course!"
</p>

<p>
Then she laughed, and went on quickly: "What
rot!" and she turned aside to pull a wild rose out of
the hedge above the pond.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I wasn't thinking about what I was
saying.  It is Peggy's sergeant who paints those
things, isn't it?" she said.
</p>

<p>
I looked at her.
</p>

<p>
With her face still turned to the hedge she went
on talking rather quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; Peggy told me her boy was 'very clever
at anything in the artistic line.'  He does designs for
belts, and mats, and cushion covers himself, and they're
sold at Red Cross sales; and the most lovely necklaces
made out of beads of wallpaper!" pursued Elizabeth,
as if she were interested in nothing on earth so much
as in the artistic productions of Peggy's boy.
</p>

<p>
But why had she coupled the names of Captain Holiday
and Colonel Fielding as if they were the names
uppermost in her thoughts?
</p>

<p>
How oddly, how aptly she'd slipped out that Colonel
Fielding!  Could she&mdash;could she have been "thinking
of him." ...
</p>

<p>
Oh!
</p>

<p>
How could I think such a lunatic thing!  In spite
of all I'd threatened of her getting "tamed" one day!
</p>

<p>
Not Elizabeth.  Anybody else, but Elizabeth&mdash;No!
</p>

<p>
I was sure of <i>that</i>.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
No sooner had Peggy brought in to our forewoman
that illuminated invitation to the wounded soldiers'
concert than there was little talk of anything else in
the Land Girls' camp.
</p>

<p>
The questions of the hour were who would sing;
what they'd sing; what refreshments would be offered;
which of the boys was going to make the best "girl,"
varied with which of us girls could dress up as the
best "boy"&mdash;given, unanimously, for "Mop," as they
called Elizabeth.
</p>

<p>
These things were discussed in twenty voices before
the farm-girls and the timber-gang set out for
work in the morning, and after they returned in the
evening.
</p>

<p>
A further burning question was whether we went in
uniform or in our civies?
</p>

<p>
At last Miss Easton, the young forewoman,
exclaimed in mock despair:
</p>

<p>
"I shall feel as if I'd been to the blessed concert
ten times over at this rate, before ever it happens!
When it does come off it'll fall as flat as a committee
report.  Whatever did they want to send out the
invitations all these days ahead for?  'Tisn't as if we'd
so many engagements in this"&mdash;she gazed out of the
hut window at the pastoral scene of lambs taking their
evening scamper round and round a daisied meadow&mdash;"in
this crowded Metropolis that we had to be booked
in advance."
</p>

<p>
Peggy returned demurely:
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Miss Easton, dear, that's all you know.  Some
of 'em at the hospital made up their minds to let all us
at the camp know in time, so that nobody should go
off on short leave to see their people or anything, by
mistake, on the 10th!"
</p>

<p>
Here Vic sighed stormily, rolled up her eyes in mock
emotion, and remarked:
</p>

<p>
"What it is to be in love!"
</p>

<p>
The usual laugh went round as at the least of Vic's
utterances.  Then the talk turned upon the love-affairs
of the Campites present.  We were given the
probable date of Peggy's wedding with her Syd in the
autumn.  We were told of the disgraceful fickleness of
Curley, the straight-haired brunette, who had been
engaged to a young gentleman in the Tank Corps, who
had shown her photograph to a friend of his, who had
taken an enormous fancy to it, and had written to
Curley who had broken off the engagement with her
first love, and who had been walking out, by letter,
with the friend ever since.
</p>

<p>
"I'm astonished at her," Peggy said severely.
</p>

<p>
"What's the good of being astonished at anything
in war-time?" retorted Curley.  "And what's the
good of going on writing to a fellow when you are
sick and tired of the sight of him before ever he goes
to France?  Better sense to break it off in time, and
see if you like the next one better when he comes
home!"
</p>

<p>
General agreement over this&mdash;except from the
red-haired Welsh timber-girl who declared in her
richest contralto:
</p>

<p>
"That wasn't love, then, for if you loved a man,
it would be for ever!"
</p>

<p>
A diversity of opinions upon this, ending in a gale
of laughter as Miss Easton reminded the red-haired
one:
</p>

<p>
"Well, Aggie!  You used to say in the woods that
the birds seemed to call aloud the name of the boy
one cared for!  And in March you said they sang
'Dick!  Deeck!'  And the other day you said they
were singing 'Hugh-ie!  Hugh-ie!'"
</p>

<p>
Aggie, blushing down her milky, freckled throat,
retorted with some allusion to some people "getting off
with some fat, old, rich timber-merchant, after the
war!"  To which the young forewoman replied
good-naturedly that she didn't mind at all the idea, of
settling down with some nice, kind, elderly sort of man!
</p>

<p>
After the war, and all she'd had to do for twenty
odd girls&mdash;seeing after every detail of their health,
behaviour, outfit, railway vouchers, billets, stripes,
rows with landladies, tests, and leaves&mdash;she would
be glad enough to come in for a bit of "mothering"
herself.
</p>

<p>
"Which," she concluded quaintly, "a girl gets best
from a husband who isn't too young!"
</p>

<p>
Chorus of&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Ah, bah!  An old husband would be awful!"
</p>

<p>
And then Sybil, who had never travelled without
a maid before the war, declared that after the war the
best husbands for the girls who had been in the Land
Army would be the Colonials, the Overseas men.
These splendid-looking outdoor fellows could offer a
girl the life&mdash;with plenty of hard work rewarded by
open-air freedom, and health, and fun&mdash;which she had
learnt to love.
</p>

<p>
Hot argument here, following a demand from Lil
the Londoner of&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter with our own boys?"
</p>

<p>
Everybody had a word to say on this perennial
poignant question of young men and marriage.
</p>

<p>
I rather dreaded being asked what my views were.
Silently I sat, going on with my work; which was
shortening Elizabeth's second smock for her.  The things
are made in three sizes only, and the smallest of them
was just a trifle voluminous, and long for the little
boyish figure of my chum.  As I stitched away at the
tuck I was taking in it, I wondered when my turn was
coming.
</p>

<p>
It didn't come.
</p>

<p>
None of the other girls asked me if I would like to
marry a dark man or a fair one, a Colonial or a
Britisher.
</p>

<p>
Then I wondered a little at that.  Afterwards, long
afterwards, I learnt the rather touching fact that Vic
had forbidden the lot of them to tease "young
Celery-face" about any young men....  Vic had tumbled to
it that, honestly, I didn't like it.  And Vic had a good
deal of fine feeling, tucked away, upon this subject.
</p>

<p>
Vic's own love-affair (her "boy" had died in enemy
hands, I afterwards heard) had made her sensitive for
others.
</p>

<p>
So, as Elizabeth had gone shopping in the tiny village
known to our mess as "the town," I was left to a
peaceful Saturday afternoon.
</p>

<p>
It was on the Monday after that that a queer thing
happened to me.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br><br>
THE HEN-WIFE
</h3>

<p class="intro">
"When I was a farmer, a farmer's boy, I used to keep my
master's chickens..."&mdash;NURSERY SONG.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
At the close of a day largely devoted to the task
concerning Blossom, the cart, and the mangolds,
I came up to the farmhouse to get their
second feed for Mrs. Price's chickens.  Of these she
had eighty, and I know she set great store by them.
She well might!  The hens, I heard, cost ten shillings
each; one speckled grey cockerel was a guinea!
</p>

<p>
Some of the hens with their brood clucked about
that midden in the yard to which I'd added by several
barrow-loads; the rest were in a field that sloped quite
steeply up the hill.  I had fed the first lot in the yard;
I had ascended the hill to the field with the coops dotted
about it, and I had shut a brood of restless, fluffy,
"peep"-ing chicks into the coop for them to feed
undisturbed by their marauding grown-ups, when
suddenly there brushed against my leggings the fluffy
white-and-golden coat of Captain Holiday's collie.
</p>

<p>
"Tock, tock, tock!" called the hens about me.
And, above me, I heard the captain's "Good afternoon."
</p>

<p>
I rose, straightened myself from putting down the
wire door of that coop, and turned to face him.
</p>

<p>
A little shock of surprise met me with the sight
of him.  He was&mdash;different.  What had he done to
himself?  I wondered in a flash&mdash;in the same flash
I realized that it was merely his clothes.
</p>

<p>
For the first time since I'd met him Captain Holiday
had changed out of his accustomed khaki.  He
was wearing tweeds.  A hat that might have done duty
on a scarecrow, with a fishing-cast about it, shaded his
eyes from the late afternoon sun.  His Norfolk jacket
was a shaggy, grey-green disgrace to a gipsy's
wardrobe ... but it suited him quite well.  I wondered
why he had never worn these things before.
</p>

<p>
After this I found myself thinking that I must have
seen him in tweeds before now.
</p>

<p>
Wasn't his figure somehow very familiar&mdash;&mdash;  But no.
How could that be?
</p>

<p>
"Good afternoon," I replied to him in the tone that
may be translated, "What do you want now?"
</p>

<p>
As if in answer, he held out to me the tin pail that
he was carrying.  With his sweetest smile he barked
out, "Rotten careless hen-wife you'd make!  I had to
bring this along to save Mrs. Price a journey.  You
forgot the milk to put in the chicks' tins."
</p>

<p>
"Did I!" I exclaimed, disconcerted.  "That was
stupid of me!"
</p>

<p>
"It was," retorted Captain Holiday, still with the
smile that might have accompanied the prettiest
compliment.  Characteristic!
</p>

<p>
I scarcely looked at him, hoping that he'd go.
</p>

<p>
He did not.  He seemed to expect me to have
something to say to him&mdash;at all events, he stayed while I
filled up those milk pannikins, and followed me round
to the other coops.
</p>

<p>
I said, looking away from him, and with would-be
irony:
</p>

<p>
"You seem as interested in poultry as in the rest
of farming."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he agreed.  "I've always been interested in
pottering about with stock of any kind.  Always the
job I fancied; 'always my delight,' as they say here;
so&mdash;&mdash;"  He broke off.  "What are you looking at?"
he asked abruptly.  "A penny for your thoughts."
</p>

<p>
I was looking up beyond the tall, slight figure set
against the background of slanting field and stone
hedge cutting a purply-grey sky.  That part of
Mr. Price's farm reminded me of a bit of the old place at
home.
</p>

<p>
How typically Welsh were the hilly green and the
grey stones, and the rich shifting colours of the cloudy
distance!  These brought back to me my Welsh-set
childhood.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Days of wandering the marshes, waist-deep in
meadow-sweet and bog myrtle, dreaming the long, long
dreams of little girlhood!  Days of sitting curled up
like a squirrel in the school-room armchair while the
rain lashed the panes and all the world of Every-day
was blotted out as I pored over Shakespere, or "Called
Back" or "The Last Days of Pompeii" or "Three
Men in a Boat"&mdash;ah, the omnivorous and profoundly
satisfying reading of the early teens!  Meals that to a
growing girl were banquets of Welsh mutton and jam
roly-poly ... tea-parties that were events ... jokes
that brought laughter that brought tears to stream
down the cheeks convulsed ... quick fierce likes and
dislikes ... shames ... delights&mdash;ah, over all,
delight!  Zest in the newness of Life!  How many of
these things had I left behind in those days-gone-by!
</p>

<p>
With a breath of the old wild mountain air, fresh
and bewildering, bringing unreasoned tears to the eyes,
those days were back, for that moment I felt the thick
brown pigtail weigh upon my neck as I bent my face
down to the face of the whimpering fox terrier pup
in my arms.  That pup had been given to me by one
of my father's farm pupils seven years ago.  I was
back in that time.
</p>

<p>
Into my day dream broke a voice that seemed, for
a second, part of it.
</p>

<p>
"A penny for your thoughts!"
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
With a start I palled myself together, glancing now
straight at the young man.  How strange&mdash;yet how
well known to me, he seemed!  Why?  The thought
persisted; why?  Of what did he remind me so elusively
at this moment?
</p>

<p>
Then an extraordinary thing happened.
</p>

<p>
I do not know how it was that I said what I
did&mdash;those five quite unpremeditated words.  My voice
sounded odd in my own ears as I spoke.  Yet it was
quite in a normal matter-of-fact voice that I did speak.
Standing there on the hill slope where the black and
the grey speckled poultry clucked about our feet, I
looked up at the young man again and asked him this
question:
</p>

<p>
"Isn't your name Richard Wynn?"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap15"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br><br>
MOSTLY CONVERSATION
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
"To talk of Love is soon to make Love."&mdash;PROVERB.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
After this strange question of mine, there was
a moment's pause.
</p>

<p>
It rang in my ears still, my quick, but
quietly uttered,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Isn't your name Richard Wynn?"
</p>

<p>
What on earth had possessed me to say that?  The
moment after I was as surprised at it as he was
himself.  Or wasn't he surprised?  His face had hardly
changed.  He looked quite steadily back at me.
What did he think?  I wondered in a flash.  What
would he say?
</p>

<p>
Quite quietly he replied:
</p>

<p>
"No, no, it isn't.  Surely you know my name's
Holiday?"
</p>

<p>
As if I hadn't ever heard it!  How absurd I'd been!
How idiotic!  How wool-gathering!
</p>

<p>
I pulled myself together.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I know," I said quickly and apologetically, as
I caught up a handful of the poultry-food.  "Yes.
Of course, I know that."
</p>

<p>
"Then," returned Captain Holiday, "why did you
ask me if my name was Richard Wynn?"
</p>

<p>
I laughed a little.
</p>

<p>
"It was a silly question," I admitted.  "It must
have sounded quite mad!  Only for one minute, seeing
you in these clothes, I suppose&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He looked swiftly down at the shaggy cuff of that
quite disreputable Norfolk jacket.  "Seeing me in
these clothes; yes&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"Tock, tock, tock," put in the grey hen.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you suddenly reminded me of somebody I
used to know," said I, and I turned to scatter that
handful to those clucking, calling fowls.
</p>

<p>
Captain Holiday&mdash;whose name ought to have been
Curiosity&mdash;put his hands behind his back, and tilted
his head to one side, taking almost the pose of a small
boy who is still at the deadly age of questions.
Evidently this tall young man had never outgrown it!
How simply, but in what a not-to-be-put-off voice he
persisted:
</p>

<p>
"What was this 'somebody' like?"
</p>

<p>
"I've just said he was something like you, Captain
Holiday.  That is," I added, "I couldn't really tell
you if he were or not."
</p>

<p>
"What d'you mean by that?" Captain Holiday asked.
</p>

<p>
I laughed again.  One simply could not feel impatient
or annoyed with this extraordinarily inquisitive
young man.  He took one past that!  So, as I
walked on with my pail to the next coop, followed by
the young man and the dog, I said:
</p>

<p>
"What I mean&mdash;if you must know all about it&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I must.  I mean I'd love to."
</p>

<p>
Well! "knowing all about it" must be a sort of
mild obsession of his.  Perhaps he'd been Intelligence
Officer or something.  The only thing to be done
appeared to be to humour him!
</p>

<p>
So I said:
</p>

<p>
"What I mean about that young man called Richard
Wynn, your double, is that I can't honestly say I
know what he was like!"
</p>

<p>
"Why can't you?" barked the catechist.
</p>

<p>
"Because I don't remember."
</p>

<p>
"You don't remember?" quite sharply from Captain
Holiday.  "How, don't remember?  Why don't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Because it's such ages ago since I saw him," I
replied.  "Seven years!  And what is the next
question, please?"
</p>

<p>
The next question was a brusque
</p>

<p>
"How often had you seen him, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Often?  Why, I saw him every day," I replied,
going down on one knickerbockered knee to wrestle
with the refractory door of a coop.  "He stayed at
my father's place for six months."
</p>

<p>
The voice above me decreed:
</p>

<p>
"Then, of course, you must know what the fellow
was like."
</p>

<p>
Extraordinary, the constant interest he took in
subjects which had absolutely nothing to do with him!
But I'd said a man was like himself.  That was next
door to talking about what he was like himself&mdash;which
Elizabeth had declared was all young men ever
did want to talk about!
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," I persisted, rattling the wire-netted
door.  "I've forgotten Mr. Wynn's face."
</p>

<p>
"You can't have 'forgotten' the face of a man
you saw every day of your life for six months,"
Captain Holiday informed me, authoritatively.  "You
must have been what?  Thirteen or fourteen.  No girl
'forgets' a man's face like that!"
</p>

<p>
"She does!" I declared.
</p>

<p>
"People don't 'forget' faces," he repeated.  "It's
nonsense."
</p>

<p>
"It is not," I cried, half-laughing, half-exasperated,
as I rose.  "People do forget what they've never
taken very much notice of, even when it was there!
I've no memory at all for faces.  I only know what I
thought of them at the time."
</p>

<p>
I thought his next question would be, "What did
you think of the young man you imagine was like
me?"  But this was not what came.  He demanded, more
casually.  "And what became of him?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," I replied.  "I never heard.
Except&mdash;&mdash;"  Here I suppressed a half-rueful smile at
the thought of what I had heard, only some weeks ago,
from this same long-forgotten Richard Wynn.
</p>

<p>
"Except what?" took up the Inquisitor.
</p>

<p>
I sighed elaborately.  For a moment I felt almost
inclined to tell him deliberately the whole madcap story
of Richard Wynn's proposal of marriage to me; but
for some reason I didn't.
</p>

<p>
So, looking straight at him, I adopted a tone of
studied and explanatory politeness.  I hoped this
gentle irony might have the effect of making him a
little bit ashamed of all his questions.
</p>

<p>
"I only heard from this Mr. Wynn once," I said.
"Then he did not tell me what he was doing, or what
had happened to him all these years.  So I can't tell
you.  And I could not write to him, or ask him about
anything, because I'd thrown away his letter."
</p>

<p>
"Thrown it away?" Captain Holiday exclaimed,
quite loudly.
</p>

<p>
"I threw it away by mistake&mdash;with the address.
So that was that&mdash;and I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
that's absolutely all I can tell you about him, Captain
Holiday!"
</p>

<p>
I scattered my last handful, let the last replete and
peeping chick out of the last coop.  Captain
Holiday&mdash;perhaps feeling a trifle rebuked&mdash;said nothing
further.  Swinging my empty pail I ran down the
hillside.  He and his dog followed me through the farm
gate and went on.
</p>

<p>
At the door of the kitchen I handed in my pail.
The rosy farm-servant said to me:
</p>

<p>
"Miss, you'll have to run if you want to catch up
your friends.  They've been gone some time."
</p>

<p>
I glanced up at the clock.
</p>

<p>
"Is it so late, Maggie-Mary!" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
I sped through the yard and on to the up-and-down
high road, thinking as I went the question that almost
every Land Girl asks herself at some time:
</p>

<p>
"How did I ever manage to walk at any pace at
all in the days when I wore hampering skirts to flap
about me wherever I turned?"
</p>

<p>
Before I could find an answer to this question I
found Captain Holiday at my side again!
</p>

<p>
"Let me walk along a bit of the way with you,"
he suggested quite nicely.  "May I?"
</p>

<p>
What could I say but "If you like"?  My way
back to camp did take him past the Lodge, after all.
</p>

<p>
However, I didn't want another Longer Catechism.
So, as we fell into step, walking towards the sunset,
down the road with basking green on either hand, I
decided to introduce the subject of the forthcoming
and much-discussed Hospital Concert!
</p>

<p>
But I was not in time.  It was Captain Holiday
who started the conversation, and on lines that I
hardly expected, but beginning, once again, with one
of his questions!
</p>

<p>
"Is that little pal of yours engaged to be married?"
</p>

<p>
Surprised, I replied:
</p>

<p>
"Elizabeth?  Miss Weare?  To be married?  I
should think not!  I mean, I don't think she ever means
to marry."
</p>

<p>
"That's good," remarked Captain Holiday, cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
I stared at him.
</p>

<p>
"'Good'?  Why good?"
</p>

<p>
He said "Oh!" and fumbled in the pocket of his
Norfolk for his pipe.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, perhaps I meant she'd be all the more company
for you down here.  People in love are poisonously
poor company, I find!" he went on, turning to
me as if with a burst of confidence.  Then he twinkled,
gave me a swift glance, opened his lips as if to ask a
question; shut them.
</p>

<p>
I knew what he meant.
</p>

<p>
Quickly and definitely I snapped out the answer to
the question he hadn't asked.
</p>

<p>
"No!  I'm not engaged either!" I said.  Then,
carrying this war of questions into the odd creature's
country, I added, "Are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Why?  I suppose you mean you find me poisonously
poor company?" he asked, with a defiant jerk
of the head in that scarecrow's tweed hat of his.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," I said politely.  "But are you?"
</p>

<p>
Instead of answering he stopped and glanced to the
right.  There was a break in the hedge.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we take this short cut home through the
fields?" he said.
</p>

<p>
I followed him to the narrow, greasy path, if it
were a path.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to me one of those short cuts home that
are certainly the longest way round! ... How could
I&mdash;oh, how could I not have realized already that all
I wanted was to be walking anywhere&mdash;for any
distance&mdash;with him!
</p>

<p>
That realization was not to come yet....
</p>

<p>
But to go back to the beginning of this ramble,
Captain Holiday, striding and smoking beside me,
said:
</p>

<p>
"Am I engaged?  Well, I say!  May I tell you
something about myself?"
</p>

<p>
"That would be a change!  Generally, you want
to be told things about other people!" I said.
</p>

<p>
He gave a short laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; well, now you can have a bit of your own
back.  I want a woman's point of view on a certain
matter.  You're sure it won't bore you?  I don't
mind if it does," he added quickly, with that quicker
smile that always brushed any offence out of his words.
"Women are put here to listen to men's grousing.
However!  Seriously, I want to talk to you.  You
could help me about this."
</p>

<p>
"I?  Help you?" I said.  "D'you mean it?"  But
I knew he meant it.  Sincerity was in his tone.
Also a new note&mdash;appeal.
</p>

<p>
I could not help feeling pleased.  He did not think me
a fool then, even if he had seen me first in circumstances
that might have given him that impression.  He thought
that I could help him in his own difficulty, whatever it
was.
</p>

<p>
This was where I suddenly found I must have skipped
whole stages in my acquaintanceship with this young
man.  He had jumped from being a busybody and a
stranger to being a friend&mdash;yes!  A friend to whom
one felt positively motherly&mdash;or at least sisterly.
</p>

<p>
I turned to him as we walked, and said:
</p>

<p>
"Of course I'd be glad to advise you in any way that
would be of any use to you.  You tell me first."
</p>

<p>
"Righto!" said Captain Holiday.  "By Jove, here's
some more of this wire.  Never mind.  We'll turn off
here&mdash;I think I struck the wrong field.  Well!  You
were asking me if I were engaged.  I am not.  I asked
a girl to marry me, though, not so long ago."
</p>

<p>
He stopped.  I said, sympathetically:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm sorry."
</p>

<p>
"Are you?  Why?"
</p>

<p>
I couldn't help opening my eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Why?  I mean&mdash;sorry she turned you down."
</p>

<p>
Now Captain Holiday opened his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Who said she turned me down?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
In spite of how he improved upon acquaintance, in
spite of his friendliness, his nice smile and ways, he was
very difficult to make out.
</p>

<p>
"You said the girl wouldn't be engaged to you&mdash;&mdash;"
I began patiently.
</p>

<p>
"I said nothing of the kind," Captain Holiday
interrupted, contradicting me flatly.  "I told you I was
not engaged&mdash;here, it must have been that other turning
after all, we'll go back&mdash;not engaged, but that I
had asked a girl to marry me."
</p>

<p>
More at sea than before, I retraced my steps down the
path beside him, and suggested:
</p>

<p>
"Then, if the girl said 'Yes' to you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"She," explained Captain Holiday, looking serenely
over the evening landscape, "did not say either 'Yes'
or 'No.'"
</p>

<p>
Now I saw his difficulty!
</p>

<p>
Suspense!
</p>

<p>
Yes.  I understood that.  How I understood the
chills&mdash;and flames&mdash;of that fever!  Hadn't I suffered
from them myself, in the days when I had had to
think in turn.  "He will," "He won't," or "Will he?"
</p>

<p>
"That's horrible for you," I agreed warmly to this
other young man.  "It's bad enough to know the worst.
But not to know which it's to be is&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Quite so," finished Captain Holiday.
</p>

<p>
"Still, you needn't make up your mind at once that
it will be the worst, need you?" I went on soothingly.
</p>

<p>
"You think I needn't?"
</p>

<p>
"Why d'you feel you must give up all hope?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes I don't," he admitted simply.
</p>

<p>
I nodded, saying:
</p>

<p>
"It's the other 'sometimes' that's so awful."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly," he said.  "When I think 'after all, why
should any girl like me particularly?'"
</p>

<p>
"You don't often think that, do you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, not often," said Captain Holiday serenely
again, "only occasionally when I've had a bad night
and feel off colour and pippy!"
</p>

<p>
I couldn't help laughing.  The sustaining, intoxicating
conceit of men!  As Elizabeth says, it's the only
thing that could keep them going since the war
restrictions!
</p>

<p>
Then he looked quickly sideways at me.
</p>

<p>
"You think that's neck," he remarked.  "Perhaps
you think there is no reason why any girl should like
me?"
</p>

<p>
And for the moment his voice dropped a tone, and
there was a wistfulness on his brown face.  I stopped
laughing.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings in any
way.  Besides, when one came to think of it, he was
quite nice enough for a girl to like him&mdash;quite much!
</p>

<p>
Thoughtfully I said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"So much depends upon the kind of girl!" and then
I asked, "What kind of girl is she?" in a tone as gentle
as I could make it, so as to avoid jarring him.
</p>

<p>
But in quite a matter-of-fact, usual sort of tone
the young man replied:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well!  She's the girl I want."
</p>

<p>
Helpful, wasn't it?
</p>

<p>
"I see," said I, not seeing anything, of course, except
that, as Elizabeth once said, it's quite impossible
to get a man to describe anything or anybody so that
you know what they are like.
</p>

<p>
We walked on for a moment in silence, following our
shadows on the goldy-green grass; evening shadows that
caricatured a giant soldier man striding across the field
beside a giantess of a Land Girl.
</p>

<p>
I began again:
</p>

<p>
"She might be the type of girl who honestly did not
know herself whether it was 'Yes' or 'No' that she
wanted to say," I said.  "Some girls simply have to
take lots of time to consider whether they care for the
man in that way or not&mdash;even after he's asked them!
They have to think things over.  They have to look
at the man from every point of view before they know
their own minds about him.  I've met that type of
girl.  I can't say I understand her mys&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ah," he put in with a quick turn of the head, "you
wouldn't be like that!  You'd know at once if you could
stand the man?"
</p>

<p>
"I think so," I said, a little shortly.  I didn't want
to be reminded of what my own views had been about
"the man"&mdash;that is, Harry.  They had led me into
making a fool of myself.  Hadn't I liked him at once,
disastrously, from his first soft dark-eyed glances at
me?  What I was "like," myself, was not the question.
Also I didn't see how it was going to help Captain
Holiday.
</p>

<p>
He, on the other hand, seemed to think it might
throw some light upon the subject.
</p>

<p>
"You'd know at once if it was all N. G. as far as your
own feelings were concerned?" he persisted.
</p>

<p>
"At once," I agreed.
</p>

<p>
"That would save the other person a lot of trouble,
of course," said the young man at my side.  "I think
you're right.  One ought to 'know' at once, about that
sort of thing.  You would, you say?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I should.  But there are such lots of different
kinds of girls, Captain Holiday&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Of course, I don't see that."
</p>

<p>
"No.  Because you're in love, you see, and people
never do see more than just the one person then."
</p>

<p>
"I expect you're right again," said Captain Holiday.
He looked down at me quite submissively&mdash;at
me, to whom he'd laid down the law in that hectoring
fashion every time he'd seen me!  He might be
right about cow-houses and the laws of gravity and
about stock, as well as about any question in his own
profession of soldiering&mdash;but at least he saw now that
I could teach him something about the ways of human
beings!
</p>

<p>
And I felt no longer a Land Girl who was still months
away from earning her first stripe, but quite a woman
of the world for once!
</p>

<p>
Encouragingly I went on:
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps she is the kind of girl who does mean 'Yes'
all the time&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And didn't say so?"
</p>

<p>
"Because perhaps she put it off to make it seem all
the more wonderful to you when it came," I suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Ah," he said.  "It would be wonderful then?"
</p>

<p>
How little he must know about love, I thought, to ask
such a question.
</p>

<p>
"Wonderful?" I said, looking away from him across
to the sunset.  In the radiance of the level rays a
swarm of tiny insects spun enraptured&mdash;each thinking,
possibly, that the sun had risen and shone only for
him and his little winged love, creatures of a day.
</p>

<p>
"One five minutes of that," I said, as much to myself
as to him, "is worth having lived for twenty stodgy
years without it.  Even if you lose it again it would
have been worth it!"
</p>

<p>
"You think so?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes!  And I do hope that it will happen like that
for you," I told him.  "I don't mean the losing it again
part.  I do hope that you will get everything that you
want."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, so do I," said Captain Holiday, in that rather
disconcerting way of his.  "But, look here&mdash;you seem
to be able to tell one so much&mdash;supposing it were
neither of those two things that you suggest that kept
the girl from answering, as I want her to?  What about
that?"
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't you," I suggested, "ask her again some time?"
</p>

<p>
He fingered his small, obstinately-growing moustache.
</p>

<p>
"That's an idea.  Yes.  Well!  Thanks very much.
I'll think about what you've said, Joan."
</p>

<p>
Joan&mdash;&mdash;!
</p>

<p>
"By the way, I have decided to call you by your
Christian name."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Er&mdash;yes," I agreed, staggered, but feeling
that I could not refuse this proof of goodwill to a young
man who had just made me the confidante of so much.
"H&mdash;How did you know it?"
</p>

<p>
"Doesn't your little pal call you by it?  Mine's Dick,
you know."
</p>

<p>
I nodded, not feeling I could use it just yet.  If he'd
been as abrupt in his love-making as he was in his
making friends, there was some excuse, thought I, for the
young woman who kept him waiting for his answer.
</p>

<p>
Then, with equal brightness, he changed the subject
altogether.
</p>

<p>
"D'you know that I'm having a house-party at the
Lodge next week?  For the concert&mdash;yes.  You've seen
my wounded pal, haven't you?  Then I've got a girl
from London and her mother coming down to stay."
</p>

<p>
"A girl&mdash;oh! have you?"
</p>

<p>
And then I could not help it.  The question slipped
out, as it were, of its own accord.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Holiday, is she 'the' girl?"
</p>

<p>
But the exasperating man wouldn't give me a direct
answer.
</p>

<p>
"The girl," he said with a laugh.  "Ah, well, I suppose
most girls have got somebody who'd consider they
were 'the' girl."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes; but I mean is she the girl you've been
talking to me about all this time?"
</p>

<p>
Again he only laughed, and said something chaffing
about "curiosity."
</p>

<p>
Curiosity indeed!  From him!  Pretty good, wasn't
it?  And not another sensible word could I get out of
Captain Holiday for the rest of the walk.
</p>

<p>
When we did finally reach the field, however, from
which we could see the corrugated iron roof of our hut
set in the trees, he did vouchsafe to me one more remark
about the girl who was shortly coming down from London.
Just after his salute and "good evening," he
turned back to me to say:
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you this much: she happens to be my own
first cousin."
</p>

<p>
However, he'd said enough&mdash;or left enough unsaid.
I knew well enough that, cousin or no cousin, she was
the girl about whom there'd been all that discussion.

CHAPTER XVI
<br><br>
CURIOUS CONDUCT OF THE MAN-HATER
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "To maidens' vows and swearing<br>
  Henceforth no credit give."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;GEORGE WITHER.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I ran back to the hut.
</p>

<p>
So late!  I found the tea-supper all cleared
away, and most of the Campites dispersed about
their evening avocations.
</p>

<p>
Only Elizabeth the trusty had kept back for me milk,
a huge plateful of bread-and-butter, and cold bacon.
</p>

<p>
I expected that Elizabeth would sit down near me
while I devoured my meal, and would spice it with
comments on the reason for my lateness.  Here I had
reckoned without my hostess.  Not only did she not
have a word to say about my having walked&mdash;or
loitered&mdash;home with a young man; but she hadn't,
apparently, got a word to say to me about anything,
though we had hardly seen each other all day!
</p>

<p>
In an abstracted way she glanced at the food
disappearing from before me, murmuring absently:
</p>

<p>
"Mustard?  Or don't you take it?"  Then, looking
at the clock said: "Slow, I'm sure."  And then,
with a curious look on her small face, she left me and
strayed forth into the gloaming outside the hut.
</p>

<p>
I finished my meal, cleared it away, and went out
to find her.  No sign of Elizabeth in the field that led
down to the bathing-pool.  I crossed the tiny bridge
over the stream, and wandered into the next field.
</p>

<p>
Here, through the branches of some hazels growing
beside a stone fence, I caught sight of the gleam of a
light overall.  I went up to it.  I found Elizabeth in
a nook where it was almost dark under the branches.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!" I greeted her.  "So this is where you've
hidden yourself away, is it?"
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth, turning, gave a violent start.  "Hullo,"
she said, in what I can only describe as a most
unwelcoming tone.  To me, her inseparable chum!
</p>

<p>
I let myself down on a boulder close to her.
</p>

<p>
"Elizabeth, old thing, what's the matter?  Have
you got a headache?" I said.
</p>

<p>
"Headache!" echoed Elizabeth quite pettishly.
"You know I never have headaches."
</p>

<p>
"I thought perhaps you were a little tired."
</p>

<p>
"Tired!  Not in the very least, thanks."  My
chum's tone was discouraging.
</p>

<p>
I tried again.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, my dear, are you stuffy with me about
anything?  Did I rag you too much about getting
tamed by Hackenschmidt the Second, or&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Stuffy?" echoed the little Man-hater, her tone getting
snappier and snappier.  "If I were, Joan, I'd tell
you."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I should have thought so," said I, feeling
perfectly convinced that something was up.  "For you
know that if there's anything I could do for you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Here Elizabeth quite took my breath away by the
suddenness with which she spoke.
</p>

<p>
"There is something you can do," she blurted out
through the gloom.  "You can just go away, if you
don't mind, and leave me alone."
</p>

<p>
I'd only just breath left to say flatly:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, righto," and to get up and set off back to the
hut.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth wanted me to leave her alone!  What on
earth was the meaning of that?
</p>

<p>
"To be left alone"&mdash;with most girls that means
that they have fallen in love and want to pick
themselves up before they can assess the damage.
</p>

<p>
But with Elizabeth?  With that genuine Loather of
Men?
</p>

<p>
Never&mdash;!
</p>

<p>
With most girls, to say "I dislike men" means one
of perhaps six things.
</p>

<p>
1. They don't know any men.
</p>

<p>
2. No men have been known to pay any attention to
them.
</p>

<p>
3. Some man has treated them very badly.
</p>

<p>
4. They wish to be contradicted and teased.
</p>

<p>
5. They are fibbing for the sake of fibbing.
</p>

<p>
With Elizabeth not one of these reasons would hold
for a second.
</p>

<p>
But Elizabeth in love!  Reason positively shouted
an "Oh, no." ...
</p>

<p>
Yet a mad little suspicion, whispering within me,
seemed to defy that voice of reason.  As I walked along
in the fast-gathering gloom I remembered I had seen
a man look at Elizabeth quite lately.  More lately still
I had seen Elizabeth most uncharacteristically confused
at the mention of that man's name.
</p>

<p>
Wildly improbable, I told myself.  And, as I did so
I walked straight into the meaning for Elizabeth's
wanting to be left to herself just then.
</p>

<p>
In fact, I bumped into the young man, who was
coming along the path.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sorry," said a low-pitched, masculine voice that
I had heard before.  A hand was put up to a cap.
Then the figure which I had run against passed quickly
on up the field.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth's "old" Colonel!  She was meeting him
out there!
</p>

<p>
<i>Him?</i>
</p>

<p>
There are no words to describe my condition of
pole-axed astonishment at this....  Why try to find any?
</p>

<p>
(<i>Elizabeth&mdash;&mdash;!</i>)
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
In about half an hour she returned to the hut, where
the others were turning up again by twos and threes.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth, looking about two inches taller than usual,
gave a defensive glare round the groups of smiling and
gossiping girls.  But none of them had seen her except
me.  The defensive glare was then focussed upon me.
</p>

<p>
I hadn't meant to say a word to the girl!  I really
hadn't!
</p>

<p>
I suppose nobody feels exactly <i>chatty</i> when they've
just fallen out of a balloon?
</p>

<p>
But Elizabeth, evidently wishful to speak, followed
me up to the mattresses when I went to unroll mine for
the night.
</p>

<p>
"Joan!  Er&mdash;he told me he met you!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes!" I said, in a voice as ordinary as possible.
I didn't want her to think I was going to "rag," or
make any sort of fuss about this.  Why shouldn't
Elizabeth go out for an evening stroll with a young man if
she wanted to&mdash;just like any other girl on the land or
anywhere else?
</p>

<p>
"He knows some of my people," Elizabeth flung back
in that defensive mutter, "and he wanted to talk to me
about another tenant for the flat in London, and, as
well as that, he's got a mother who's got a friend who's
got a daughter who's thinking of joining up for the
Land Army.  So, you see, he wanted to&mdash;talk to me."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I quite see," said I.
</p>

<p>
Three excuses for talking, from a young man whom
she only called "He"!
</p>

<p>
"So he wrote to me.  I promised I'd see him for a
minute after tea tonight."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes.  When did you promise that?" slipped
from me before I knew.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth gave her mattress a little kick as she lugged
it out.
</p>

<p>
"I met him on the road the other day," she said in
the tone of one who shakes a fist at the world&mdash;what
it is to have to live up to the name of Man-hater!&mdash;and
added: "You needn't think there's any nonsense of that
sort about it!"
</p>

<p>
"I never said there was," mildly from me.
</p>

<p>
"You're always ready to think it!" tigerishly from
her.  "So I thought I'd just tell you, to stop your
getting any wrong impression!"
</p>

<p>
"Righto!" said I, pacifically.  "I won't think
anything about it, old thing."
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth gave a queer little sigh&mdash;was it of
gratitude?&mdash;as she spread her blankets.
</p>

<p>
Whether she was just annoyed at the possibility of
my thinking she had taken a fancy to a mere man who
admired her, or whether she really had begun to take a
fancy&mdash;well, I gave it up as I settled down to my
well-earned rest.
</p>

<p>
I'd said I wouldn't think any more about it.  As a
matter of fact I was too stunned by the extraordinary
possibilities of the subject.  I left it.  I turned to the
thought of Captain Holiday's other guest for that
concert, that girl from town who was coming to stay with
her mother at the Lodge.
</p>

<p>
I found myself wondering over her again during the
few minutes that elapsed between my curling up on my
mattress and my losing consciousness of that and every
other question.
</p>

<p>
It was all very well for that young man to announce
so succinctly, "She's just the girl I want."  What did
he think that would convey to me?  She would be rather
lucky, as luck goes, to have any one so nice and amusing
in love with her.  But what sort of a girl would a man
like that want?
</p>

<p>
Absolutely no frills about her, I decided.  She would
be extraordinarily practical and efficient; very out of
doorish; good-looking, but not pretty in any "doll-y"
sort of way; thorough sportswoman&mdash;only, why hadn't
she wanted to say either "yes" or "no" to him?
Why not "yes" at once?  Why not&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Here a curious little incident wound up a day of
curious incidents.  I had, whilst engaged in these
meditations, been tucking my wrist watch under the rolled-up
scarf that was my only pillow.  My hand met a
handkerchief that I had forgotten was there.  As I took
hold of the thing I felt a knot that was tied tightly in
the corner of it.
</p>

<p>
A knot to remind me of something.
</p>

<p>
Now what was that, and when had I tied it?
</p>

<p>
Suddenly I remembered.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth had tied that knot in my green silk
handkerchief days and days ago.  And she'd said: "That's
to remind you to think mournfully of Harry at least
once a day."
</p>

<p>
I'd forgotten that.  More than that, I'd forgotten
Harry for the moment&mdash;or for how long?  Had it
really been days since I had given a thought to those
bitter-sweet memories of the man who used to blot out
every other interest from my horizon?  Had the
land-work cure progressed so rapidly that other interests
were beginning to keep all remembrance of Harry in the
background?
</p>

<p>
I looked back to the obsession that had been the
indirect cause of sending me&mdash;a love-sick wreck!&mdash;on
to the land.
</p>

<p>
And now&mdash;was it possible that I'd got over it so
well?
</p>

<p>
In ruefulness, relief, and surprise I drew a deep
breath.  Then I turned over and slept.
</p>

<p>
But I never dreamt of what else was coming to
remind me of Harry&mdash;and very shortly!

CHAPTER XVII
<br><br>
LAND-GIRLS GO SHOPPING
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Quand on n'a pas ce qu'on aime, il faut aimer ce qu'on a."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;FRENCH PHILOSOPHER.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
A few days after I had been wondering what
Captain Holiday's "the" girl would be like,
my curiosity was gratified.
</p>

<p>
I met her!
</p>

<p>
This was how it occurred:
</p>

<p>
I was out in "the town" shopping&mdash;fascinating
occupation&mdash;don't any woman's eyes brighten at its
name?
</p>

<p>
Yes....  But the chances are ten to one against
her knowing anything about the Careg Land Girl's
Camp version of the function.
</p>

<p>
Not for us the dear delights of window-gazing, of
comparing prices and textures in one big, temptingly
set-out establishment after another....  Well, we got
our delight in another way.
</p>

<p>
Shopping for the girls was a game of chance and skill,
I can tell you.  It "combined all the charm of novelty
with that of big game-hunting!" as Vic put it.  It
meant diving into the funniest little caves of shops, all
garlanded by festoons of such different kinds of goods
as picture post-cards, hanks of darning cotton, and
onions.
</p>

<p>
It sometimes included vaulting over the counter
ourselves, and helping dear old ladies to forage for what
we wanted in a wilderness of cardboard boxes at the
back of the shop.  And even after our search it
generally meant that we went on our way disappointed, to
the accompaniment of such remarks as "No, indeed, I'm
very sorry!  I'm sold out of every bit"&mdash;of whatever
it was we wanted&mdash;"and I don't know when I shall
ever see any!  It's the war, yes, yes!  I haven't got a
ha'porth of nothing of the sort, not in the whole place!"
</p>

<p>
This seemed to be the keynote of supplies in the
town, late on that very wet Saturday afternoon when
I had accompanied Vic, and Peggy, the tiny Timber-girl,
to do the shopping for the rest of our camp.
</p>

<p>
"Got the list, Celery-face?" said Vic.  As we sheltered
for a moment in an archway I pulled out the long
list of commissions which our colleagues had drawn up
for us.
</p>

<p>
Optimists!  They really thought we could get these
things for them in "the town"!
</p>

<p>
I read aloud.
</p>

<p>
"Last two numbers of <i>The Tatler</i>."  (I expect the
latest number they've got at the station here is April 1,
Nineteen Five.)
</p>

<p>
"Pot of lemon-marmalade; you could get it at
Morris's.  (I don't think.)
</p>

<p>
"Sybil wants jasmine soap, 1<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>."  (Why not the
moon?)
</p>

<p>
"Two skeins of floss embroidery silk, deep cream or
nearest."  (The nearest is Regent Street, I expect.)
</p>

<p>
"Reel of black cotton, No. 40, packet needles, No. 9's,
brown shoe-laces, broad."  (All asked for, and none
to be had.)
</p>

<p>
"Shocking!" was Vic's cheery verdict.  "As for the
packets of grey square envelopes for Miss Easton,
nothing doing&mdash;and there was I pinning my faith to them
having a good line in salvage stock left over from the
Ark, this being the last place where the Flood stopped&mdash;not
that it ever has really stopped in Wales, if you
ask me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that eternal joke about the weather in Wales!"
I laughed.  "Just as if it didn't rain much harder in
plenty of other places!  Have you ever stayed in
Surrey, by the way?  <i>That's</i> where it never leaves off!"
</p>

<p>
"It 'ud have a job to beat this beauty-spot today,"
persisted Vic, winking the rain from her lashes.  "Look
at it!"
</p>

<p>
It certainly was a soaking wet afternoon, Wales
running Surrey a good second for once.
</p>

<p>
For it certainly was a soaking wet afternoon!  The
clouds were a blanket of indigo, from which the rain
poured in millions of white streams, hissing on to the
narrow, little, slate-paved street, all shiny with puddles.
Tossing the drops from the brim of my Land Army hat,
I went on reading the list of ordinary every-day things
which we Land Girls in the damp depths of that wilderness
found as hard to come by as gold!
</p>

<p>
I read.
</p>

<p>
"'Gramophone needles.' (No earthly.)
</p>

<p>
"'Dri-ped for Curley's boots.  (No.)  'Tin of
toffee.'  (No.)  'Sticking-plaister.'  (No.)
'Oranges.'  (What are they?)  'Writing-pad.'  (Bagged
the last.)  'Shampoo-powder, any decent sort that
smells nice&mdash;&mdash;'"
</p>

<p>
"Aha.  Who's wanting to make her hair smell nice
all of a sudden?" demanded Peggy with interest.
"I'm astonished at her!  Who is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't know," I fibbed valiantly&mdash;for I knew
perfectly.  It was young Elizabeth who had begun to want
to minister to that thick, soft hair-crop of hers in this
way....  A sign of the times!  That fixed it, surely?
I exchanged a soulful though still half-credulous glance
with the nearest cottage-window, blank with rain.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't tried Mr. Lloyd, the only chemist's, for
that yet," I went on.  "Shall we go on and see if he's
ever heard of such a thing?"
</p>

<p>
Cramming the list into my pocket, we set out again
down that river of a street.
</p>

<p>
The chemist's shop was at the other end of it.
</p>

<p>
And as we splashed down the street we had a little
adventure of the kind that had probably occurred to
more than one set of land girls.
</p>

<p>
A group of lads who encountered us began to laugh
and jeer at our uniform&mdash;they themselves were in
"civvies," mackintosh and caps.  Farmers' lads from
remote places in the mountains!
</p>

<p>
I don't know what they said, but from the tone it was
obviously not complimentary.
</p>

<p>
So feeling that blank discomfort which falls upon
the average girl at any man's incivility, I found myself
clutching Peggy's arm in order to hurry past, and
saying hastily: "Come on, Vic&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But Vic, to my horror, had paused.
</p>

<p>
She left my side.  She took a step towards the nearest
of the lads, a rosy-faced nineteen-year-old with a
ragged thatch of black hair showing under his bowler
hat.  There she stood, firmly planted on the streaming
road, handsome head well up in the rain, figure held
proudly erect, and she demanded in a voice that rang:
</p>

<p>
"What's that you're saying about us?"  A sheepish
giggle from the group; not one of the boys spoke.
</p>

<p>
"You were saying we ought to be ashamed of ourselves,
wasn't it?  Something like that, eh?  That's
what you think of us, is it?" Vic went on.
</p>

<p>
"I'd like just to tell you what we Land Army girls
think of you!" Vic announced.  "And that is, that it's
you who ought to be ashamed of yourselves!  Huh!
Why aren't you in France?  Can't leave the farm, you
can't.  You're sheltering yourselves behind the land,
you are.  You ought to be standing shoulder to
shoulder with the rest o' the Royal Welsh Fusiliers.
</p>

<p>
"You've got regiments.  Nobody can say they don't
fight all right.  Yet here you are at home.  Exemption,
eh?  Indispensables&mdash;I don't think.  Who's to milk
father's cows?  Well, we've volunteered to do that.
That's what we're here for.  That's why you can't bear
to see us about the place.  You're afraid&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Mutters from the boys here.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you're afraid that when it's shown that we
girls can do most o' your work you'll be pushed out
after all!" went on the relentless Vic.  "So you try
and bring a bad name on the Land Army, you little
blighters, who take jolly good care you aren't in any
army at all!  You make game of our uniform, you that
haven't a suit o' khaki among the lot of you!  Nice
ones you are to talk!"
</p>

<p>
Here there was an uneasy movement in the enemy's
ranks.
</p>

<p>
Skulking little wretches!  There are some of these
in every place, town or country&mdash;the dregs of a noble
race whose cream was taken first of all.  Probably as
soon as our backs were turned they would have wheeled
round and begun to shout after us again.  But this
Vic did not mean to allow.  She kept her face turned
squarely on the retreat.
</p>

<p>
She called out after them:
</p>

<p>
"Making fun, were you, because we girls wear the
breeches?  A good job for the country that we do!
As for you, it's a pity they can't take and make you,"
raising her voice to a shout, "wear petticoats!"
</p>

<p>
They were now out of ear-shot, so she turned, flushed
and triumphant.
</p>

<p>
"I'm astonished at you," Peggy launched her favourite
dictum reproachfully, as we plodded on in the wet.
"I wouldn't stoop to answer back a lot of louts like
that.  I wouldn't speak to 'em."
</p>

<p>
"Daresay you wouldn't," retorted Vic, good-humouredly,
"but if we were all as jolly dignified as you
and Celery-face here, those Cuthberts would go through
the rest of their natch never knowing what a decent
girl thought of 'em!  So I thought I might as well
demean myself to tell them off proper just for once in a
way!"
</p>

<p>
With which conclusion we found ourselves just
outside the tiny chemist's shop.  A dog-cart was drawn
up there&mdash;little did I suspect at that moment who had
driven in it!  I only noticed that it was occupied by a
little stable-boy who did odd jobs about the Lodge for
Captain Holiday.
</p>

<p>
Well, in we all three clumped to the shop with
coloured globes and show-cards and dangling bunches of
"baby's-comforters" and sponges of Victorian date.
And here there met our astonished eyes that figure that
was so utterly and entirely uncharacteristic of "the
town," or of anything at all in the country round
about it!
</p>

<p>
It was a girl, in an ultra-smart, white and black
rubber rain-coat, with a small black and white rain-hat set
at an indescribably French angle on her head.  Our
first glimpse of her, as she stood with her back to us and
her face to the obviously paralysed little Welsh chemist,
gave us the impression of some slim and elegant magpie
who had flown in there to shelter from the rain.
</p>

<p>
She was speaking.  Her high-pitched, clear drawl
seemed to belong to Bond Street.
</p>

<p>
"But d'you mean to say you don't keep any of
Roget et Collet's things?"
</p>

<p>
Then, as we Land girls came clumping and dripping
in, she turned with a little stare that seemed to say,
"What figures of fun have we here?"
</p>

<p>
Our rainy-day kit is scarcely dainty.  That brown
Board of Agriculture mackintosh with the flappy
cape-sleeves seemed to amuse the pretty townified girl.
</p>

<p>
Ravishingly pretty she was in her small-mouthed,
big-eyed, Lily-Elsie style with an authentic curl twisting
in front of her pink ear, and eyelashes to which the
rain-drops hung.  How perfectly suited, too, by the
costly simple "rightness" of her clothes.  Girl and
"get-up" composed a type one would scarcely have
expected to see here.
</p>

<p>
The last person I expected to see&mdash;for I had seen her
before!
</p>

<p>
With my second good hard look at this fashionable
vision I recognized her.
</p>

<p>
"Hul-lo!  You here?  It is you, isn't it!" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
She opened her eyes at me, while Peggy and Vic stood
by in amazement that this chic magpie apparition should
be known to me.
</p>

<p>
I hadn't been mistaken, even though I could not
imagine what should bring her here of all places in the
world.  It was she all right.
</p>

<p>
It was Muriel Elvey, the girl who had taken Harry
from me!
</p>

<p>
Muriel opened her big eyes even more widely upon me.
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious!  Is it?  Yes, it's Joan Matthews!
How priceless!" she exclaimed in that pretty drawl
of hers.  She glanced from me to the other two Land
Girls and back again.  "Of course!  How d'you do?"
</p>

<p>
Here she extended her small, perfectly-gloved hand
towards my sunburnt paw, that I saw for the first time
was irremediably roughened by farm work.
</p>

<p>
I saw that Miss Muriel took in this and every other
detail of my appearance, while she went on gaily:
</p>

<p>
"Isn't this too funny?  The last person I'd ever
dreamt of seeing!  Of course, I'd heard you'd gone on
the land, Joan, or something quaint like that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Why 'quaint'?" thought I, while the same thought
showed on the faces of my two mates.
</p>

<p>
"But I didn't know at all which bit of 'the land'
it was supposed to be," concluded Muriel.  "Isn't it
appallingly hard work?  Can you stand it?  It would
kill me," she went on.  She always could chatter
nineteen to anybody else's dozen.  "I get fearfully done up,
with my own war work."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know you did any."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear, yes.  I go round to no end of hospitals
in town and play the piano to the men.  They adore
it," declared Muriel.  "Only the nurses are such cats!
Women never can be decent to me, somehow I had a
fiendish row with one ward-sister&mdash;all jealousy on her
part, of course.  I simply came away.  But what a
place to come away to, isn't it?"  She gave a tiny
grimace about the musty village shop, and towards the
glimpse of streaming wilderness outside.  "And
imagine my meeting you here!"
</p>

<p>
I spoke up.
</p>

<p>
"Well, but imagine meeting you!  I thought you
were never to be seen away from London or some
civilized seaside town?  What brings you to Careg?"
</p>

<p>
For even yet the whole situation hadn't broken upon
me.  Only, I was sore and ruffled, and utterly upset
by this meeting with Muriel.
</p>

<p>
It was opening an old wound.  I'd thought I'd
forgotten.  But, brought face to face with this girl for
whom Harry had left me before he sailed, my heart
throbbed as painfully as it had on that ghastly
morning when I'd got that note to say he'd gone.
</p>

<p>
Now I wondered with a stab if she were actually
engaged to him?  I hadn't heard that she was.
</p>

<p>
She, the unexpected one, gave a pleased little laugh.
</p>

<p>
"What brought me to Wales?" Muriel replied.
"You may well ask, my dear.  I was positively
dragged down here.  Pestered out of my life to come!
By a man, of course.  No!"&mdash;laughing again&mdash;"you
needn't look as if you thought it must be a romance.
He is merely a cousin.  My cousin Dick Holiday&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;?" I echoed, thoroughly petrified by this.
Her cousin?  He was Muriel's cousin?  He, who had
been talking to me of "the" girl&mdash;and who had allowed
me to leap to the conclusion that she and the girl-cousin
who was coming down to stay were one and the same
person!  Violently I had leapt to that conclusion.
Quite violently, in my haste, I thought now:
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  The man-snatcher!  She took my Harry.
Now she's annexed Captain Holiday.  She takes everybody!"
</p>

<p>
"I promised him I'd come down with mother and play
the piano for his soldiers and things at some priceless
concert or other that he's giving," Muriel Elvey went
on.  "His big place down here is turned into a hospital,
you know.  That is," with a glance at my muddy boots
and uniform, "I don't suppose you've met him, of
course, but he's&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What, Captain Holiday?" Vic broke in, unaddressed
and heartily.  "Not met the gent what's giving
the concert?  Met him?  Huh!  I should shay
sho!"
</p>

<p>
Muriel, with an indescribable stiffening of her pretty,
well-turned-out figure, stared up at the big Cockney
Land Girl who thus accosted her.
</p>

<p>
Vic leaned against the counter, beaming.  She might
have stood for the symbolical figure of Young Democracy,
gazing tolerantly down upon costly Convention.
</p>

<p>
"All us girls'll be turning up at Captain Holiday's
concert," Vic told her.  "It's going to be some beano,
I give you my word.  So you're going to oblige, too,
are you?  See you then!"  She gave a little nod, and
turned to the chemist who had been listening with the
concentration of a male gossip to every syllable of this
conversation.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Mr. Lloyd!  What about this shampoo
powder we've heard so much about? ... What's in
that box, there, to the right? ... There we are!  Egg
and lemon&mdash;and very nice, too.  Sixpence?  Right!
Good-bye-e-e-e!"
</p>

<p>
Vic marshalled us out of the shop with a friendly grin
divided between the chemist and Muriel Elvey, who was
left standing there&mdash;utterly pole-axed, I am sure by
this glimpse of the sort of companionship into which
one was launched when one joined the Land Army.
</p>

<p>
I could see that she found Vic "too impossible for
words!"
</p>

<p>
This hurt me for my messmate and pal, though I am
convinced Vic knew little and cared less about the fact
that she had just been looked upon as a young female
hooligan!  I tramped back along the "puddlesome"
roads to camp in a state of mind that I had not known
since I'd shaken the dust of London off my feet in the
spring.
</p>

<p>
Still "minding" so dreadfully about Muriel Elvey
and Harry?
</p>

<p>
Why be surprised because men fell like ninepins
before her expensively-shod feet?  Yet I was astonished.
Not at Harry.  At that other man for whom she was
"the" girl&mdash;or so I'd convinced myself.
</p>

<p>
Surely, though, Captain Holiday should have been
the exception to the rule that men adore the Muriel
type?
</p>

<p>
Yes; I'd made up mental pictures of this girl of whom
he'd talked without mentioning her name.
</p>

<p>
To think that the girl he wanted could be a Muriel!
</p>

<p>
She was the girl of whom one couldn't think without
setting her in the background of restaurant-lights,
hothouse flowers and Bond Street dressmakers.
</p>

<p>
When one saw Muriel, one saw always her "things":
Muriel and her pearl-string; Muriel and her gold-mesh
purse with tiny powder-box and lip-stick attached;
Muriel and her mauve leather dressing-case; Muriel and
her ivory manicure-set.
</p>

<p>
Each was a lure, each was a mesh of the net for a
man like my lost admirer Harry....  His people were
now exceedingly well-off, but there had been no luxury
in his boyhood, which, as he'd told me, had been passed
in a bleak little house behind the shop where the money
had been made, penny by penny, to give him his chance.
</p>

<p>
At twenty-five, luxury was still rather a new delight
to him.  He could not take it for granted, poor
darling; he who had never seen his mother with any
"pretty" things of her own.  Hence the reaction.
He loved a woman to have "possessions."  He adored
her to "fuss" incessantly about her nails and skin and
hair.
</p>

<p>
But Captain Holiday, I thought, liked such different
things!
</p>

<p>
Him one couldn't think of without a background of
out-of-doors; woods, mountain, field&mdash;and perhaps a
manure-heap with a Land Girl working there.
</p>

<p>
And now (so I persuaded myself) he had become
infatuated with and wanted to marry a boudoir-type of
girl, who hated to go out in a wind!
</p>

<p>
Ah, the tricks that are played by the charm of
Contrast! ... and why should I feel sore about them?

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br><br>
THE NIGHT OF THE CONCERT
</h3>

<p>
At last the great day of the long-discussed
Concert arrived.
</p>

<p>
At last the burning question was decided
whether we Campites were to attend in uniform or
"civvies."
</p>

<p>
Popular opinion had been in favour of Sunday-go-to-meeting
clothes.  Some girls had wired home to hasten
their parcels.  The red-haired Welsh timber-girl had
been all delight over the prospect of adorning herself
in a blouse of rose-pink voile with flowers embroidered
in coarse white cotton.  How entirely it spoilt her
looks!  In fact, there was scarcely a girl in that camp
who didn't look a thousand times more attractive in
uniform than she did in an ordinary hat and frock.
</p>

<p>
Uniform does manage to be always "right" in a way
that only the most successful "other clothes" ever
achieve.  But only one woman in twenty can ever be
persuaded to see that.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth and I were highly pleased, however, when
the verdict came from the forewoman that uniform was
to be worn at the concert after all.
</p>

<p>
That concert began early, in order to finish early.
We should never have time to get back from work, have
our tea, and change into civilian clothes before we set
out again for the hospital&mdash;particularly the gang of
timber-workers, who were now in the woods, two miles
beyond the training farm.  And it wouldn't look nice
to have them in uniform and the farm-girls out of it.
We must be all alike, decided Miss Easton, and smarten
up our working kit by getting into a clean smock and
giving our boots an extra polish.
</p>

<p>
Grumbling broke out&mdash;what camp in either the
women's or the men's armies could go on without its
grouse?  But the girls agreed to lump it, as it had to
be.
</p>

<p>
"After all, the boys'll have to be in their everlasting
hospital blue, with those chronic red ties o' theirs that
I'm getting fair fed up with the sight of, so we'll be
fellow-sufferers in distress," pronounced Vic cheerfully as
she swallowed her tea, left the table, and then got to
work on another pair of brogues.
</p>

<p>
"After you with that brown boot-polish, young
Mop"&mdash;to Elizabeth&mdash;"and when you've finished with
the glass, Peggy, p'raps you'll find me a clean
handkerchief, the thieves in this place having pinched the lot
of mine.  Ho!  Why do I talk in this unfemin-nine
style?  Most unwomanly I call it.  Effects of this here
life in camp," she rattled on good-humouredly.
</p>

<p>
"I shall have to mind myself presently, before that
refined pal of Celery-face's.  Her what's going to play
the piano.  She didn't half give me a nasty look in the
chemist's.  Sure she thinks I'm no lady.  Now what's
her little game?  Is she trying to get off with the
Captain, Celery-face?"
</p>

<p>
I said a trifle bitterly:
</p>

<p>
"If she likes people, she does not have to 'try' for
them."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, is she one o' those lucky ones," said Vic, cheerfully
shining her brogues.  "Well, I'm going to watch
the young lady tonight, and see what she makes
of&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hurry up, you girls!" urged Miss Easton from the
porch.  "The concert starts at a quarter to.  It's
time we were off!"
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Well!  As Vic said, we were to "see life" that
evening at the concert.
</p>

<p>
The scene was that big comfortable country house
transformed into that jolly hospital for the boys from
the Front.  Its enormous double drawing-room must
have witnessed plenty of "county" dinner-parties; dull
and formal functions, no doubt.  Nothing dull or
formal about tonight, now that it was turned into an
impromptu music-hall!
</p>

<p>
The wounded lads buzzed about it like a swarm of
blue bees giving an At Home, welcoming the visitors,
showing them into the rows of seats set in the lower
half of the room.
</p>

<p>
"Here you are!  Land Army to the right!" a cheery
voice hailed us as we trooped in&mdash;twenty-odd girls in
uniform.
</p>

<p>
It was Peggy's sergeant who greeted us.  His hair
was varnished brighter than the parquet floor; he wore
the largest rose I have ever seen in his button-hole, and
the gaudiest lucky golliwog decorated his red tie.
</p>

<p>
"I was to reserve these seats for you young ladies.
The best, of course!" he beamed upon us.  "Stalls this
way, if you please.  Peggy, you sit at the end of the
row so that you can pop out quick in the interval."
</p>

<p>
"I'm astonished at you," came a Timber-girl's retort
as we settled into our seats and looked about the
bright, crowded place.
</p>

<p>
The farther end was occupied by the stage platform
with the piano set near the wings.  A curtain had been
made of what looked like all the spare quilts in the
house.
</p>

<p>
Standing in front of this (as I saw directly we came
in) was our host, Captain Holiday.
</p>

<p>
Evening-dress made him taller and different, both
from the smart soldier he was in khaki and the country
sportsman he seemed in those dilapidated tweeds of his.
Suddenly he seemed a stranger again to me.  It chilled
me.
</p>

<p>
He was talking to one of the soldiers, a red-haired
Blue Boy, with a good-looking, clean-cut, actor-ish face.
I heard Captain Holiday saying:
</p>

<p>
"Righto!  I'll tell the Colonel to let you fix him up.
That's in the second part."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said the red-haired boy.
</p>

<p>
Captain Holiday, looking down the room caught sight
of our party.  I heard him give an "Ah."  He smiled,
nodding at me.  This was somehow cheering after that
slight chill.  He made a movement forward, I think&mdash;I'm
sure he was coming to speak to me.
</p>

<p>
But at that moment a pretty, coquettish voice called
"Dick!"
</p>

<p>
And there entered, by a door nearer the stage, Muriel
Elvey and her mother.  Mrs. Elvey, the sort of mother
who never is anything but an adequate "background"
to her daughters, looked placid and pleased in
well-fitting black, with diamonds.
</p>

<p>
As for Muriel, she was lovely, yes, lovely! in her
Frenchiest little frock of pinks and mauves, and mingled
heliotropes.  The girlish, low-cut bodice of it had no
sleeves, and was held up over her white shoulders by
strings of palest coral beads.  She was a vision such
as Careg had never seen.  No wonder the Blue Boys
gazed!  No wonder the Land Girls, in their clean but
coarse overalls, bent forward and studied her with the
rapturous, envying sighs they would have heaved over
some exquisite fashion-plate!  No wonder that she was
followed by a slim masculine shape in black-and-white
that was Colonel Fielding.
</p>

<p>
He, too!  No wonder, indeed, that her cousin, Captain
Holiday, was at Muriel's side in an instant, bending
his dark head over her golden one, with its fillet of
coral-pink buds.
</p>

<p>
Now, curiously enough perhaps, that sight spoilt the
whole first part of the concert for me.
</p>

<p>
At first I didn't know why.  Such was my incredible
self-deception that I gave myself quite the wrong
reason for the fact that Muriel Elvey came between me
and any enjoyment of the playlet "Poached Eggs and
Pearls," excellently acted by a company of nurses and
wounded.  I was beset, I told myself, by the promptings
of jealous memory.
</p>

<p>
I pictured that golden, rose-filleted head of Muriel's
close to another dark head.  Harry's!  That was what
I couldn't help thinking of.  I watched Muriel&mdash;the
centre of all eyes as she sat at the piano&mdash;and I
realized what she'd meant to Harry.  Not a thought had
he had for me after that evening when I introduced him
to her.  And now history was repeating itself.  Now
Captain Holiday hadn't a look for anybody else.
</p>

<p>
It hurt.
</p>

<p>
Oh!  Not the Captain Holiday part, of course!  I
assured myself hastily&mdash;the other.  I'd thought I
was getting over that.  How queer are the workings of
that most painful passion&mdash;jealousy!  Brooding, I
sat there with my mates, enjoying themselves on each
side of me.  I laughed with the others, with the others
I watched the stage, and clapped when the curtain
fell&mdash;to Muriel's music&mdash;for the end of the first
part.
</p>

<p>
Then Captain Holiday, still standing by Muriel at
the piano, called out:
</p>

<p>
"There will now be an interval of fifteen minutes!
War-time refreshments will be found in the dining-room."
</p>

<p>
So, with a scraping aside of chairs and a babel of
voices, the audience surged out of the "theatre."  I
went with the others.  But that black mood of mine had
swept my mind away out of my new and joyous country
life, back to the bad old days of London after Harry
left.
</p>

<p>
I sat on a big chair near the door, and watched.
</p>

<p>
Each Land Girl had found a wounded soldier or two
to attend to her.  Vic, with Elizabeth under her wing,
was the centre of a group of blue.  Then a long glass
of lemonade was brought to me by the pleasant-faced,
red-haired lad I had noticed with Captain Holiday.  He
talked to me in a gentle, but curious, voice, husky, yet
high-pitched.  For he told me he'd been shot through
the lungs.
</p>

<p>
"Done me in for the profession if I go back after the
war," he said cheerfully.  "Spoilt my singing voice."  He
told me he'd been on the stage from the time he was
ten until he joined the Army in 1914.
</p>

<p>
Here Sergeant Syd, coming up to us with an arm
through Peggy's, broke into the conversation.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and you'd have been all right, you silly
blighter, if you'd have stayed where they wanted to keep
you, down at the base singing to the boys in rest camp.
You needn't ever have left there!  But no.  He would
go up the line, Miss."
</p>

<p>
The red-haired actor warrior agreed in the husky
voice that was spoilt for song:
</p>

<p>
"I wanted to go up the line.  After all, I didn't join
to go on singing."
</p>

<p>
Another aspect of life: the obscurely heroic that is
taken for granted every day!
</p>

<p>
"Corporal Ferrant," said a voice at his elbow.  It
was Muriel again.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, will you go to the Colonel's room now?" she
said pleasantly.  "He's ready for you to make him
up."  Then:
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, Joan!" she said.  "What do you think of
this priceless show?  My hands are dropping off with
playing so hard."
</p>

<p>
She glanced around.  Then she let herself down
lightly on the arm of my chair as if she wanted to say
something particular to me.
</p>

<p>
"I say," she said, with a sudden little shrewd glance
at me.  "Wasn't it funny about Harry Markham?"
</p>

<p>
"Funny?" I echoed, startled.  "What&mdash;which was
funny?"
</p>

<p>
Muriel, adjusting her pink shoulder strap, answered:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, just his getting brought back to Blighty again
after he'd had only three weeks in Salonika!"
</p>

<p>
Harry?  In England?  The first I'd heard of it.
Yes; naturally she'd know and I shouldn't.  But it was
bitter!
</p>

<p>
"Apparently the General can't do without him," she
went on.  "I expect Harry's jolly glad to get back to
London.  I had a note this morning from him; forwarded.
Of course he tore up to see me as soon as he
arrived."
</p>

<p>
"Of course he would!" said I, with quite a successful
laugh.
</p>

<p>
Muriel, watching my face, said:
</p>

<p>
"I expect you know I saw a lot of him after that night
you introduced him at 'Romance'&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I knew."  Didn't I!  I nodded quite cheerfully
at this pretty, prosperous girl who had written that
letter to me in the spring.
</p>

<p>
Through the confused chatter of the crowded room
Muriel spoke confidentially.
</p>

<p>
"He&mdash;&mdash;  Well, between ourselves, he went absolutely
mad about me, you know.  Proposed and proposed&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Really," said I, with another composed nod.  Every
word drove straight into my heart.  Harry had
proposed.  Several times!  Were they actually engaged,
then?
</p>

<p>
I was too proud to ask, but how I wanted to know!
</p>

<p>
"He's quite nice," Muriel remarked critically.
"Quite good-looking.  Quite amusing to go out with.
One enjoyed Harry's taking one out.  But marrying
him might be another matter; because&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Here she stopped.  The stage-bell was ringing.
People began to scramble past us out of the room.
</p>

<p>
"I must go," cried Muriel.  "The second part's
beginning now."
</p>

<p>
But I held on to an end of her mauve sash.
</p>

<p>
"Wait&mdash;&mdash;!" I said.
</p>

<p>
I felt I must know about Harry.  "Because," she
said&mdash;and stopped.  Did it mean because she meant
to marry her cousin?  I simply must find out, for
Captain Holiday's sake.  Remember, I still believed she
must be the girl of whom he'd told me "she hasn't said
'Yes' or 'No' to me yet."  She must mean "Yes," I
thought excitedly.
</p>

<p>
I kept close to her as we moved out of the doorway.
</p>

<p>
"Do tell me, Muriel," I urged, "what you were going
to!"
</p>

<p>
She laughed, enjoying her power to tease.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you want to know if I am going to be engaged
to Harry or not?"
</p>

<p>
"You said 'not.'"
</p>

<p>
"No, I didn't.  I simply said marrying him
might&mdash;only 'might'&mdash;be another matter."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," I agreed hurriedly, "but why?"
</p>

<p>
Muriel's answer was not one I should have dreamt
of hearing from her.
</p>

<p>
Tilting her fair head, she smiled over her white
shoulder and said:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well!  Because, after all, he isn't a gentleman,
is he?"
</p>

<p>
This remark was a shock to me.
</p>

<p>
Harry Markham&mdash;"not a gentleman&mdash;"  To hear
Muriel say it!
</p>

<p>
Just because Harry's father, that self-made man,
hadn't "made" himself in time to send his son to a
public school?  Didn't that seem rather like ... well,
hideous snobbery?
</p>

<p>
Further, for a girl to let a man take her out to the
theatre, the opera&mdash;for her to accept innumerable
dinners and taxi-drives from him, and then for her to
sum him up to another girl as "not a gentleman"&mdash;didn't
it sound like ... to put it kindly, ill-breeding?
</p>

<p>
It surprised me so from Muriel because after all she
was a lady!
</p>

<p>
But&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Would any girl who was a gentlewoman at heart have
been guilty of such a remark?
</p>

<p>
And did Captain Holiday, who also&mdash;as I believed&mdash;wanted
to marry Muriel&mdash;did he know that she was
the sort of girl who would say such a thing?
</p>

<p>
I was resentfully wondering over that as the pink
and mauve figure of Muriel slipped back to her seat at
the piano.  I returned to my chair next to Sybil, and
the second part of the soldiers' concert began.
</p>

<p>
Now the opening item was a clog-dance by a merry-faced,
one-armed Lancashire Fusilier.  It was good;
but I could not fix any attention on the stage just then.
</p>

<p>
Was Muriel going to marry Captain Holiday, who
had now drawn up a chair close beside hers at the piano?
Or did she mean after all to take Harry?  Which?
Which?  Did she know herself, yet?
</p>

<p>
And&mdash;here an odd thought came to me as those
clogs pattered faster than a shower of summer
rain&mdash;did I myself know which of those two young men I
least wanted Muriel to marry?
</p>

<p>
"Clicketty clicketty clack clack!" went the clogs
on the stage; I watched, with the others, while the light
twinkling feet within them danced on and on.
</p>

<p>
I was thinking all the while.  Of course it would
break my heart if I saw that pretty girl at the piano
actually married to the man she had already poached.
Yes, of course it would, I told myself resolutely; but
at the bottom of my heart I was stifling a mad little imp
of an idea.  This whispered:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You wouldn't mind if Muriel married Harry now.
Although it was a stab, it wasn't a deep one.  Don't
pretend!  For you are really through with Harry.
It is not about Harry that you are worrying any
more!"
</p>

<p>
&mdash;Ah!  Now I was getting nearer the truth.  I was
coming to it, coming...  But I still told myself it
was Harry whose engagement would hurt me.  Why
should I mind if&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Here a storm of applause broke out all round me.
It was the end of the clog-dance, but in the midst of
the din I went on revolving my own little problem.
</p>

<p>
I told myself that, of course, it was comparatively
nothing to me if Muriel chose to marry this devoted
cousin of hers, Captain Holiday.  He (I considered,
personally) was rather too good for her.  Still, most other
people would consider that no man could be too good for
a girl as lovely as Muriel Elvey.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, it was no business of mine.  Who was I?
Merely a Land Girl, sunburnt and coarsely clothed, a
worker in training at a farm on Captain Holiday's
estate.  Why should I care twopence about this whole
question?  I didn't care.  Of course, I didn't care.
</p>

<p>
Here Sybil, who had secured a programme, leant over
me to look at mine.  The next item read: "Song:
'Until!' by Sergeant Sydney Escott."
</p>

<p>
"Ah," said Vic, with feeling, "now we are going to
hear something.  Eh, Peggy?"
</p>

<p>
All the Land Girls were leaning towards the smallest
Timber Girl, chaffing and smiling encouragement.
Peggy, to whom this was "the" item of the programme,
popped a piece of toffee into her mouth, and assumed a
look as if she had never heard the singer's name before.
</p>

<p>
But just as we expected to see her sweetheart jump
up on to the platform, one of the other blue-coated,
red-cravated boys came up in answer to a nod from
Captain Holiday, bearing under his arm a large cardboard
placard.  This he put up, carefully, in the number-stand
at the side of the piano.  The word upon it in
large scarlet letters was "Extra."
</p>

<p>
Everybody in the hall murmured it aloud.  Vic's
carrying voice rose above all the others.
</p>

<p>
"'Extra'?  Now what's this goin' to be?  Surprise
turn, eh?" she said.
</p>

<p>
She was right.
</p>

<p>
With an arresting jerk it brought me out of the
mood in which I was beginning to forget that there
was a concert going on about me at all.  It brought
me straight back to where I was, in the entertainment
hall of Captain Holiday's Hospital, in the middle of
a crowd of eager, enjoying people.
</p>

<p>
Truly it was to be a startler to me, the surprise turn
that came on next!

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red mouth like a venomous flower,<br>
  When these are gone by with their glories,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What shall rest of thee then, what remain,<br>
  Oh wicked and sombre Dolores."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;SWINBURNE.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There swept down towards the impromptu
foot-lights an apparition tall and beautiful.
Dressed as a Spanish lady, it was a study in
black, white, and red.  Black was the mantilla draped
so filmily over the glossy black hair, black was the
sequined gown that clung to the slim shape, black was
the fan that waved, beckoned, hid, revealed and hid
again in a series of gestures, each more perfectly and
subtly coquettish than the last.
</p>

<p>
White was the handsome face, whiter the proud
shoulders above the cut-out bodice.  Scarlet was the
carnation worn just under the ear, and vividly scarlet
were the made-up lips of this new performer.
</p>

<p>
"Whoever is it?" ejaculated Peggy, loudly, and
then clapped a hand over her mouth.  But there was a
perceptibly louder buzz in the talk all over the hall.
</p>

<p>
"Say; who's she?"
</p>

<p>
"Isn't she beautiful?"
</p>

<p>
"Lovely figure&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Little bit o' Dixie, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Sssh&mdash;&mdash;  The Captain's goin' to make a speech
about her!"
</p>

<p>
For Captain Holiday had stepped forward from his
place by the piano and had, with a sort of little laughing
flourish, taken the lovely creature's black-gloved
hand.
</p>

<p>
"Ladies and gentlemen," he announced, "as an extra,
my friend Signora Dolores has kindly consented to sing
an old-fashioned song, entitled 'Carissima.'"
</p>

<p>
He went back to his seat.  Muriel at the piano, with
an unexpectedly sweet smile towards this rival beauty,
this wonderful stranger who was to sing, struck the
first rippling chords of an accompaniment.
</p>

<p>
Then, from those vermilioned lips there broke out in
a low contralto voice the first notes of the song:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Carissima, the night is fair&mdash;&mdash;"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
What a voice!  It was not powerful&mdash;indeed, it
seemed to me as if the singer were using only part of
it&mdash;but to what purpose!  It was sweet as the deepest
brown honey, and of a quality that&mdash;well!  even as the
water-finder's rod goes straight home to the hidden
spring, so that kind of voice, "finds" the listener's
heart&mdash;finds tears.
</p>

<p>
Surprised at myself, I blinked those tears away.  I
glanced from the black, white and scarlet beauty on
the stage to the audience for a moment.  All
spellbound, all a-gaze.
</p>

<p>
I saw little Mrs. Price&mdash;a row back&mdash;slip her hand
into that of her gentle giant beside her.  I saw Vic's
face without a smile, full of brooding tender memories.
I saw Elizabeth all tense ... the soldier-boys were
serious, intent; the country people behind them looked
as full of solemn, poignant enjoyment as if this were
not a mere Concert, but a funeral itself.
</p>

<p>
As for me, I was ashamed of myself.  I had to bite
my lips and clench my hands as the syrupy Victorian
melody was crooned out to the inanely Victorian
words:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Carissima!  Cariss&mdash;ima!<br>
  The night and I wa-ant oh-oh-oh-only thee!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Yes; I was having to fight those senseless tears away
from my eyes as I listened.
</p>

<p>
Oh!  It wasn't "cricket" for that woman to sing
so that she could reduce a healthy matter-of-fact
Land-worker to this state of&mdash;of mushy sentimentality!
</p>

<p>
She did more than that.  Before the end of the
second verse she made me realize something that left me
gasping.
</p>

<p>
I was just thinking, while I listened:
</p>

<p>
"Ah, if her voice goes so straight home, unconsciously,
what must be the effect if she sings 'at' somebody?"
</p>

<p>
Then I saw her do that very thing.  Slightly, raising
the fan with a little studied gesture, the singer tilted
her head and launched from under her eyelashes a
deliberate glance at Captain Holiday.  I saw him raise
his brown chin out of his hand and look back at her
hard, too.
</p>

<p>
Then I saw the Signora's reddened lips tremble, even
through the song, into the very wickedest of smiles that
would not be suppressed.  It dimpled her powdered
cheeks; it almost shut her long-lashed eyes; what a
tantalizing and lovely sight!  But everybody in the place
must have seen that she was singing "at" him; must
have heard it!
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Carissima!"<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
cooed that wooing contralto with its invincible appeal,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cariss-ima!<br>
  My boat and I will come to thee."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And with "thee" the glance was more unmistakably
"at" Captain Holiday than before.
</p>

<p>
Then I knew.
</p>

<p>
This Spaniard&mdash;if she were Spanish?&mdash;this
stranger with the voice and the fan and the shoulders,
and the slim hips and the witching glances that surely
no man on earth could withstand, must be "she" of
whom Captain Holiday had spoken to me!
</p>

<p>
Not Muriel, after all.  The blonde prettiness of
Muriel looked positively ineffectual beside this vivid
brunette.  She, yes! she must be "THE" girl he'd
meant.
</p>

<p>
Here was a discovery.
</p>

<p>
But the annihilating part of it was this&mdash;that I
minded horribly.
</p>

<p>
For in a flash I felt that I could not deny it to
myself.  No longer could I pretend to my own heart.
Jealous I was, more so than I'd ever been before.  But
now it was not because of Harry at all.  It never would
be Harry again.
</p>

<p>
It was mad pain to me to see a woman&mdash;any
woman&mdash;bent upon attracting Dick Holiday.
</p>

<p>
Yes, I'd come to the truth now.  This had shown it
to me.
</p>

<p>
At last I realized that I was in love with him....
</p>

<p>
Here was a discovery, wasn't it?
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
In love with Captain Holiday!  Of all people in the
world!
</p>

<p>
What in the world had he ever done to make me in love
with him?
</p>

<p>
That first time at the hut he had been hideously rude
to me; had come up to me and, unintroduced, had asked
me how long I thought I was going to stick life in the
Land Army!
</p>

<p>
I remembered his smile as he said it.
</p>

<p>
Then that next time in the cowshed.  He'd come upon
me in the act of chucking work, and he'd let me know
that he knew it.  Then he'd laid down the law to me
about the way to "muck out," as the country phrase
has it, the way to hold a pitchfork, and the way to
trundle a barrow up to the manure-heap.  Nothing in
that to make a girl take any sort of a fancy to him!
</p>

<p>
Later on, he had informed me that I should make a
rotten poor hen-wife, just because I'd forgotten the
milk for the chickens' food!  Not very endearing, that
remark!
</p>

<p>
That same afternoon, however, he had been friendly.
He'd walked back with me, talking all the way.  But
what about?  His own love affair.  The problem of
the girl to whom he had proposed, and who had said
neither "yes" nor "no" to him.  And I&mdash;not realizing
that I was getting too fond of the sound of his
voice whatever it happened to be saying&mdash;I had asked
him what sort of a girl she was.  He'd said the words
that had been ringing in my head ever since: "Ah,
well!  She's just the girl I want."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
And now here she was; I saw her before me, the
beautiful Spanish-clad singer, on this very concert
platform, not more than arms' length from him.
</p>

<p>
I found myself simply hating her!  The last words
of her song&mdash;oh! how that tune of "Carissima" was
going to haunt me&mdash;melted away.  Muriel played the
last chord, and again the racket of applause broke out.
</p>

<p>
She smiled with all her white teeth; she bowed, gracefully
enough but put her hand with a curious little jerk
to her side as she did so.
</p>

<p>
How the boys clapped her!  So did I, of course, and,
holding myself well in hand, I exchanged comments on
the lovely voice with the other girls through the clatter
and the cries of "'Core!  Encore!"
</p>

<p>
The Signora gave a little nod that she would take
the encore to Muriel, who was clapping as enthusiastically
as any of the audience.
</p>

<p>
And the second song she sang was the revue success:
"For the First Love is the Best Love!" which she
rendered as perfectly as she had the Victorian ballad.
I could have murdered her for that!
</p>

<p>
Half in anguish of jealousy, half in rapture because
of the performance, I sat listening again.  She had the
low, throaty deliciousness of some of Miss Violet
Loraine's own notes; very wisely, she was imitating her as
closely as possible in her rendering of her best song.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The new Love<br>
  Is never the true Love!"<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
she carolled, and again I felt the keen stab of seeing her
mischievously tender glance at Captain Holiday.
</p>

<p>
Oh, yes.  She must be going to take him&mdash;after that!
</p>

<p>
And at the end of the song, when she stood still
again, swaying her fan to the applause, she maddened
me by a further piece of deliberate coquetry.
</p>

<p>
Putting up a hand to the coal-black hair under her
mantilla, she took out the scarlet carnation that was
tucked close to her ear.  She kissed the flower with
those lips, painted so red.  Then, holding it for a
moment, she smiled from the carnation to Captain
Holiday, if saying, "Shall I let him have it?  Shall I?"  She
made a little, quick gesture as if to toss it to him,
across the platform.  Then, with a lightning-swift
shake of her lovely head, she took that flower and threw
it down into the auditorium for any to catch who could.
</p>

<p>
A dozen hands went out for it.  I don't know if she
were specially aiming at the row in which we Land Girls
found ourselves, but at all events the carnation dropped
almost straight into the small, brown, competent paw
of Elizabeth, my chum, who had always been used to
catch and throw a cricket ball just as a boy does.
</p>

<p>
She, Elizabeth, tucked the scented souvenir into the
breast of her overall.  The signora, standing tall and
slim just above the footlights that beat up on to the vivid
white and scarlet of her make-up, sent down one more
smile&mdash;a specially witching one.  Then she withdrew.
Captain Holiday set up another piece of music on the
piano, and the concert proceeded.
</p>

<p>
It was Peggy's sweetheart, the sergeant, who sang next.
</p>

<p>
At least, I fancy it was.  For, to tell you the truth,
I have only the most confused impression of the various
faces and figures that appeared, one after another, close
to Muriel's piano on that stage.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes it was one of the red-white-and-blue
wounded boys.  Sometimes the slim, white-frocked
figure of the village schoolmaster's daughter, for whom
they brought in a harp.
</p>

<p>
I was drawn away from it to the drama in my own mind.
</p>

<p>
I&mdash;to have grown to care for Captain Holiday!
Fool that I was to have allowed myself&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
But, then, I hadn't allowed myself.  I had not known
it was happening.  Now it had irretrievably happened.
Tonight had shown me that too plainly.
</p>

<p>
What fate was upon me?  Twice in my life I had
been doomed to fall in love with the wrong man.  First
with Harry Markham, who certainly had done all in
his power to bring it about.  Now with Captain Dick
Holiday, who had never flirted with me for an instant.
</p>

<p>
Well, I must try to cure myself as soon as possible&mdash;that
was the only thing.
</p>

<p>
I must, somehow, take myself severely in hand and
refuse to let myself mind so horribly because a woman
with a voice to match her lovely face had got Captain
Holiday at her feet.
</p>

<p>
But for the life of me I could not help wondering who
the singer was.  Signora Dolores&mdash;was she really a
Signora?  Or was she an English girl of an arrestingly
Spanish type?  Where had she come from?  And when
had she come to Careg?  How long was she going to
stay in the house?
</p>

<p>
I wondered how Muriel liked that Spanish girl who
had so completely taken the shine out of her.
</p>

<p>
I wondered if she&mdash;the wonderful singer&mdash;were
going to sing again.
</p>

<p>
She did not.
</p>

<p>
I realized that this was more of her coquetry; to
make one marvellous appearance, to reap her success,
and then to refuse to reappear until the last note of
"God save the King" had been sung, with all the
wounded soldiers, and ourselves of the Land Army,
standing to attention.
</p>

<p>
Yes; at last it came to the end of the concert.  Votes
of thanks had been proposed and seconded.  Cheers had
been given for our host, Captain Holiday, for the
performers, and for "the pretty young lady who had so
kindly consented to act as accompanist," but there was
no further sign of the lovely lady who had sang
"Carissima."
</p>

<p>
I supposed that she, with the rest of the house-party,
would be having a merry little supper afterwards,
presided over by Captain Holiday.  I am afraid that at
the thought of this I felt myself literally trembling with
passionate envy.
</p>

<p>
The audience, laughing and talking, began to move
slowly from between the rows of chairs out from the
concert-room.  I found that I was deadly tired; an
evening of emotion takes it out of a girl considerably
more than a day of farm-work!  I turned for comfort
to the sturdy little boyish figure of Elizabeth.
</p>

<p>
I made myself say, "It has been jolly, hasn't it?"
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth nodded her bobbed head.
</p>

<p>
I glanced at the red flower she had tucked into her
overall, and said: "That woman, you know, who sang
those two songs, she was the best of all."
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth, with a very quick look up at me, asked
brusquely, "Which woman?"
</p>

<p>
I had opened my mouth to answer, "Why, the Spanish
lady, of course," but the words froze on my lips
at the picture of which I had caught sight at this
moment.
</p>

<p>
In the vestibule, at the foot of the wide stairs, stood
Captain Holiday, laughing whole-heartedly; a group of
people were clustered about him and about another
figure standing close to him waving a big black fan.
This figure was the sight that arrested me.
</p>

<p>
It was tall and slim-hipped, clad in a black and
spangled gown with a low-cut bodice that revealed noble
white shoulders; it was, as far as the figure went, that of
the Signora Dolores who had appeared at the beginning
of the second part of the concert; but&mdash;where
were the mantilla and the glossy black tresses over which
it had been so artistically draped?  Gone&mdash;one with
the other!  Above the white shoulders appeared the
laughing face and the small mercilessly-groomed golden
head of a young man!
</p>

<p>
"Topping girl he makes, doesn't he?" I heard the
voice of the red-haired actor-soldier say just behind me.
"That's when I make him up; his own mother wouldn't
know him.  Why, the female impersonator we had in
our Brigade troupe isn't a patch on him; not the
professional who used to get fifteen quid a week salary!
Asked me for a few tips, he did.  But there was nothing
I could teach him; only lace him into his 23-inch
ladies' corsets&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I was gasping as I looked.  Now that I saw the black
wig dangling from the hand that held the fan, now that
I knew&mdash;oh, I felt I ought to have guessed before.
</p>

<p>
The things that give away any masquerading "girl"
were there.  Bert Errol and Co. have not yet learnt to
hide the thickness of the wrist, the muscle down the
neck just under the ear, the checked and conscious
movements of limbs that know no medium between
mincing and the normal stride, and (most unmistakable
of all) the angle of the male arm at the elbow, which
makes "V" instead of "U," as in a woman's soft arm.
</p>

<p>
All the rest was&mdash;what an excellent disguise!
</p>

<p>
"Elizabeth!" I exclaimed stupidly, "look!"
</p>

<p>
"I know," said Elizabeth briefly.
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear," I said, still aghast over the revelation
that Dolores was not "THE" girl, not even "a"
girl, "did you know when she&mdash;when he was singing?"
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth, with a hand at the red flower in her smock,
said: "I knew days ago.  Colonel Fielding told me
himself that he was going to."
</p>

<p>
Colonel Fielding!
</p>

<p>
The "lovely" stranger was&mdash;Elizabeth's "old Colonel."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
<br><br>
LAND ARMY TESTS
</h3>

<p>
The discussions of the concert, after it had
happened, went on for as many days in our
camp as the pre-concert discussions.
</p>

<p>
I'll skip those.  I'll skip the days which suddenly
seemed to have "gone flat," with all the thrill gone out
of Land-work, for the time being.  I'll skip my own
broodings&mdash;which were those of just any other girl in
love with a man who prefers another woman!  For
since it could not be the "Signora" I concluded that
it was Muriel after all.
</p>

<p>
I'll come to the next excitement in the Land-worker's
life&mdash;namely, the test-exams.!
</p>

<p>
You see our time was nearly up at the Practice Farm.
Our six weeks' training was drawing to a close.  If,
at the tests, we gained a certain percentage of marks,
Elizabeth and I would be considered "finished pupils,"
and we would be passed out and sent off.
</p>

<p>
Where?
</p>

<p>
Heaven and the Organizing Secretary of the County
knew where that job would be found.
</p>

<p>
I told myself that I only hoped it would be a good
long trail away from Careg, away from the farm of
bitter-sweet memories.
</p>

<p>
Vic was instructive on the subject of the changes
to come.
</p>

<p>
"Any people ought to like the look o' you two, now
you've shaped to the work," she kindly remarked.
"Still, you never know whether looks is going to help a
girl or to stand in her way in this world.  A nice thing
it would be if you was landed like one of the
smartest-looking girls I ever saw join up, Chrissie Devon!"
</p>

<p>
"What happened to her?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Chrissie was fine with horses," Vic said, "all her
people having ridden.  She was a clever girl, well
educated, and a beautiful figure on horseback.  I-T, she
was.  The secretary got her a job with a brother of our
Mr. Rhys, the bailiff, who keeps a lot of horses.
Thought it would be just the right thing for her.  So
it would have.  The only thing was, our Mr. Rhys's
brother didn't consider himself half-artful.  He&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Vic broke off to laugh.
</p>

<p>
"He turned up at the station before the one that she
was going to, and saw her in the train.  And," Vic
concluded with an impressive nod, "sent her back to the
depot by the next one.  Then he strafed our poor little
organizing secretary till she didn't dare see him for a
year.  'The idea!' says he, 'of sending me a girl that
looked like that!  Me, a widower.  She would be
owning the horses and me inside o' six months!'"
</p>

<p>
"So then," Vic told us, "Chrissie was sent to a very
old married couple up in the hills.  The old man was
about ninety, and the old woman p'raps a shade more
juvenile.  Chrissie worked her hardest for them.  But,
if you'll believe me, she didn't give satisfaction there
neither.  The old woman asked our secretary if she
couldn't be removed.  And when the secretary asked
what was the grouse, it turns out that the old woman
was certain that the new Land Girl had taken it into
her head that she would be 'his second.'  I ask you!"
</p>

<p>
"And where did she go to next?" Elizabeth asked.
</p>

<p>
"Chrissie?  Oh, now's she going in for motor-tractor
driving.  She don't stay long enough in one place to
put anybody's back up with her fatal beauty.  That's
the story of her.  I wonder what they'll do with you
and Mop?"
</p>

<p>
The day of the tests arrived.
</p>

<p>
It should have seen the arrival also of the examiner
from London.  Of this unknown personage we were
all, including the gentle giant, Mr. Price, in a state of
terror.  However, a telegram came to say that this
magnate was unable to attend.
</p>

<p>
His place was taken by the local examiner, who turned
out to be that other Mr. Rhys, the widower who had
strafed the organizing secretary for sending him a
too-good-looking Land Girl.  Now he and that secretary,
a little bright-eyed Welshwoman who had been a school-marm,
had evidently made up their difference.
</p>

<p>
She, the secretary, had come over to help with the
tests, for which we had in the big farmyard an audience
that I had not expected.  Not only these examiners and
the two Prices looked on while I brought in the cows to
the stalls and set to work with stool and pail, but also
the visitors from the Lodge!
</p>

<p>
Heavens! how my heart sank into my clumping Land
Army boots as I beheld the little procession coming
through the red-painted farmyard gate.  Captain
Holiday, in those disgraceful but becoming grey tweeds
of his, was walking with Mrs. Elvey in her smartest
toque!  Behind them the slim-waisted, uniformed figure
of young Colonel Fielding, escorting Muriel Elvey.
</p>

<p>
"We've come to look on at the tests, if we may,"
Captain Holiday announced cheerfully to the Prices.
</p>

<p>
Greetings were exchanged with the ladies, and though
I kept my eyes quite steadily upon the work that I had
in hand, I could not help seeing Muriel's amused stare
and smile, just as I couldn't help hearing her treble
twitter to the men of "mustn't it be too quaint to have
to wear those clothes and things&mdash;and how wonderful
not to be afraid of all those great animals&mdash;I should
be terrified of cows, I know I should."
</p>

<p>
Indulgent laughter came from all the men.  I
remembered one of Elizabeth's contemptuous axioms about
the sex&mdash;"a pretty girl can't be too helpless or too
afraid of mice to please a man, even now!"
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth, at this moment sitting beside the cow,
Blodwen, wore her most man-hating looks upon her
small, set face.  As for me, I felt that now, on this
occasion of all others, when, as a Land-worker, I ought to
have been at my best, I was absolutely at my worst,
nervous, flurried and awkward.
</p>

<p>
I had a hideous presentiment that I should overturn
my milking-pail, or some fiasco of that sort!
</p>

<p>
Raging inwardly, I approached the black-and-white
cow who had become my friend.  She was the easiest
in the stable, as Mrs. Price had said on that first time
of all when I had milked her.  But now, to my horror,
I realized that she was going to fidget and to be difficult.
She was going to "let me down" before all these people!
</p>

<p>
Suddenly I heard Captain Holiday's voice, not
brusque as usual, but quiet.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Muriel, my child," he said, "stand outside
the door, will you?  If strangers go and stand close
up to the cow when she's being milked she gets
bad-tempered and there's no doing anything with her."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, isn't there?  I didn't know.  I'm so sorry,"
said Muriel, airily, and she fluttered out to stand beside
Colonel Fielding.
</p>

<p>
Feeling grateful beyond words to the man who had
helped me thus, I went on milking with more assurance.
The nervous flurry melted away from me.  I
succeeded in forgetting that I was doing what I was
with a maximum of so many marks for "approach,"
for "time," for "quantity," for "clean-stripping."
</p>

<p>
I forgot Mrs. Elvey's lorgnette upon me from the
cow-house door; and the eyes of the others, and the
chatter of Muriel to the two young men.
</p>

<p>
I just did the best I could.
</p>

<p>
Presently Mr. Rhys, the examiner, had taken Elizabeth
and me into an empty shed, and, looking doubtfully
upon us, began to ask us simple questions as to our
everyday work.  I was glad to realize that&mdash;as is so
often the case with the male examiner&mdash;he was more
nervous than we were.  Or did he think that we, too,
had designs upon his widowerhood?
</p>

<p>
At all events, the marks that Mr. Rhys put down
upon his papers seemed to be satisfactory.
</p>

<p>
"Well, after all, I may have squeezed through!" I
thought.
</p>

<p>
And half an hour later Mrs. Price came to Elizabeth
and me in the kitchen, where she had insisted upon our
having a cup of tea after our labours, and told us that
we had both got through our tests with nearly full marks
in all subjects.
</p>

<p>
Pride filled my heart, as you may imagine.  Surely
it was not an unnatural thing for the thought to flash
across me:
</p>

<p>
"Well, now Captain Holiday will hear that!  He'll
know that I am not a complete imbecile at my job after
all, even if he did go away this afternoon before he saw
that I had got over my nervousness!"&mdash;for the whole
of the Lodge party had disappeared towards the farm
before I had begun upon my second cow.  "He'll have
to think that I am some sort of a credit to him after all
the tips he's given me.  And perhaps he will say so to
Muriel, even if he is in love with her."
</p>

<p>
And then I put away those thoughts.
</p>

<p>
As Elizabeth and I tramped back to camp with the
glad news that we were now fully fledged Land-workers,
I turned resolutely to the future and the new job.
</p>

<p>
The little organizing secretary had promised to let
us know in a day or two what she had settled for us.
She had also promised to arrange that Elizabeth and
I should be sent somewhere together.
</p>

<p>
For the meantime we were to stay where we were in
camp, as it seemed scarcely worth while to move us to
the depot.  The secretary said she was almost certain
she had got us our job&mdash;at a rectory with a farm
attached.  It was at the other side of the county.
</p>

<p>
"That's a good thing!" thought I.
</p>

<p>
I did not say so to Elizabeth.  I hadn't confided a
word to Elizabeth of what I felt.  I had taken my
confidence away from the once-intimate chum.
</p>

<p>
And then suddenly her confidence returned to me;
in fact, I had it as I'd never had it before.
</p>

<p>
It was on the afternoon after we'd passed our
tests&mdash;Sunday.  (On the Monday we were to hear for
certain about that new job of ours.)  I'd missed Elizabeth
shortly after the midday meal, and I found her in that
old haunt of hers on the wall under the bushes.
</p>

<p>
Crouched up there she was sobbing as if her heart
would break.
</p>

<p>
I was afraid she would be furious that I'd come upon
her like this.
</p>

<p>
But the unexpected happened.  She turned and clung
to me.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Joan!  I am so unhappy," she sobbed.  "Oh,
it's so awful.  We are going away from this place, and
I shall never, never see him again!"

CHAPTER XXI

THE MAN-HATER DISCUSSES MEN

"Man delights not me."&mdash;SHAKESPEARE.
</p>

<p class="poem2">
  "And the taable staained wi' his aale, an' the mud o' 'is Boots o'<br>

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I didn't ask for any explanation.
</p>

<p>
I had the sense not to show any surprise at
the self-abandonment of this usually so sturdily
reserved little chum of mine.
</p>

<p>
I just plumped down on the stones beside her and
slipped my arm about the sobbing little overalled body.
I suppose it comforted her.  For presently she left off
sobbing, drew a long breath, blew her nose, and began,
in a resigned little voice, to open out her whole heart to
me.
</p>

<p>
"You know who I mean, Joan?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, old kid."
</p>

<p>
The name of "<i>Colonel Fielding</i>" seemed to hang in
the air above us as tangibly as those hazel boughs
against the sky, but neither of us uttered it.
</p>

<p>
In rueful little spurts the truth began to gush from
the once silent and matter-of-fact Elizabeth.
</p>

<p>
"I guessed you'd guess.  Oh, Joan!  I'm idiotic
about him.  Crazy!  As silly about him as you ever
were about your precious Harry in London.
</p>

<p>
"I used to laugh at you!"
</p>

<p>
"Everybody starts by laughing at people in love,"
I said, settling myself on that wall.  "And everybody
ends by being quite as silly themselves.  You're no worse
than anybody else."
</p>

<p>
"Yes I am, much," declared Elizabeth.
</p>

<p>
"Why?  Because you've always thought you couldn't
like men, and now you find you can?"
</p>

<p>
"No!" declared Elizabeth, shaking still more vigorously.
"I still can't like 'men.'  It is still true
enough about <i>that</i>.  I still hate <i>them</i>! ... You don't
mind my talking, do you?  I've bottled myself up so
ever since I met <i>him</i>.  But as for '<i>men</i>'&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She talked, setting out plainly and sincerely what I
do believe is the attitude of a certain type of girl.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Men seldom hear it.  If they do, they disbelieve it.
But let them&mdash;if any of them are reading this story&mdash;be
reminded that this point of view exists.  Here's
its creed as told me by my bonniest and best of little
pals, Elizabeth Weare.
</p>

<p>
I'd heard lots of it, in scraps, already.  Tonight,
when she was stirred and troubled, I got it in swathes,
which I scarcely interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think men are amusing," she declared.
"Perhaps I <i>have</i> no sense of humour.  If it is sense of
humour that makes their smoking-room stories funny,
I am glad I haven't.  They think those stories funny,
I think them far-fetched; as if they'd been thought out
with lots of trouble.  It's not the improperness of them
that I mind, those that are supposed to be so 'naughty.'  <i>It's
the ugly sort of pictures they nearly always make</i>.
Think of any you know; don't they mean something
rather horrid to look at?  Men haven't enough
imagination to see that's what one hates.  Men laugh at
those 'jokes,' with a noise like the Prices' old Jack,
braying.  And they tell some of them to their wives.
And the wives pass them on.  And the girls tell me;
pretty girls, with their soft red mouths, repeat these
hideous stupid Limericks and things.  And I feel like
<i>crying</i>, Joan.  Only I have to laugh, or they'd think
I didn't understand.  What I <i>do</i> understand is that
every time <i>I've been put a little bit more off men!</i>
</p>

<p>
"Then, I think men are dull.  They don't hear what
you say quickly enough.  They don't see what it means
half the time.  And they aren't noticing what's going
on around them.  They're wrapped in a <i>fog</i> of
newspaper print and tobacco.  They're slow.  Slow!
</p>

<p>
"I think men are so ugly, too.  Look at them in
omnibuses and trains.  Look at them anywhere!  Are
they attractive?  Not to me.  I don't like their nubbly
knuckles and their huge feet (not that I need talk in
these land boots, but still)&mdash;I can't bear those great
wrists they have.  I hate their horrid skins where they
shave&mdash;all nutmeg-graters!  How any girl wants to
be kissed by them I don't know.  I don't suppose she
does really; it's just the Idea.  Bristly moustaches,
too.  Awful!
</p>

<p>
"They do such hideous things, men.  What can be
more revolting than the sight of one of them knocking
out a dirty, smelly black pipe?  Or wolfing down a
plateful of half-raw steak?  Or mopping up&mdash;as they
call it&mdash;a fat pint of beer out of a pewter pot?  I
could not love one after seeing him do those things!"
declared Elizabeth.
</p>

<p>
"Yet women do, my dear," I reminded her.  "They
like a man to be even rather rough-hewn and coarse-fibred,
so that he is unlike them.  They don't mind his
smelling of tobacco, and wearing scratchy tweeds, and
tanks on his feet.  They like him rugged.  I&mdash;I speak
for myself and for the majority of girls, I think.  They
like him 'manly.'"
</p>

<p>
"Heavens!" ejaculated Elizabeth, with equal fervour
and truth in her voice.  "How I do loathe what they
call 'a manly man'!  All lumps, and a bull's voice, and
irregular features!"
</p>

<p>
"But," I suggested mildly, "you wouldn't want a
man to look like the picture off a chocolate-box lid?"
</p>

<p>
"I should adore it," declared this exception in girls.
"When I was a little girl, once, I was given a box of
sweets with a picture on the lid called 'The Falconer.'  He
wore a golden-brown hunting-dress and he had a
hawk on his shoulder, and golden hair and soft eyes,
and, oh! such a pretty face!  I thought at the time,
'If only I could ever see a young man looking like that
Falconer!'  And now I have.  Colonel Fielding is
exactly like that picture.  Oh, Joan, I think he's the most
beautiful thing I've seen."
</p>

<p>
How true it is that when a really reserved person
breaks down the barriers it will babble out ten times
more than some one who is more expansive in every-day
life!
</p>

<p>
I, for instance, should never have dreamt of calling
any young man "the most beautiful thing I'd seen."  Not
Harry, handsome as he was.  Not Captain Holiday,
though he was good-looking enough for any girl
to rave over; manly good looks, too.  Very different
from the namby-pamby prettiness of Elizabeth's young
Colonel!  Personally, I considered that it would take
more than his D.S.O. and the devotion of his men to
their officer to make one forget that he could dress up
and look exactly like a girl!
</p>

<p>
Yet here was the boyish, resolute, no-nonsense-about-her
Elizabeth glorying in the fact!
</p>

<p>
Again the force of Contrast, I supposed.
</p>

<p>
Well!  Well, if the Man-hater were drawn to him I
could only hope it was for her happiness.  She didn't
look happy at the moment, sitting there on that wall,
her chin on her knees and her hands hugging her
gaitered legs.
</p>

<p>
"To think," she mourned, "that at last I've met the
sort of man that I could care for&mdash;even I who never
do care for them!&mdash;and that it's no good!'
</p>

<p>
"Why 'no good,' my dear?  Because we're going
away?  But he's not going to stay in Careg himself
for ever!  Besides, he'll write to you.  He always did
about the flat, and he will more now," I comforted her.
"I know he likes you."
</p>

<p>
With her characteristic gesture my chum shook her
head till her hair danced about her face.
</p>

<p>
"He does like you," I persisted.  "I saw it when
he met you first!  And at the concert he threw that red
carnation straight for you to catch!  I suppose you've
kept it?"
</p>

<p>
A rueful laugh from Elizabeth, a movement of her
hand to the breast of her smock.  Kept it?  It was her
treasure.  Oh, yes.  She'd got it badly.
</p>

<p>
"Besides," I went on, "he met you.  He came to talk
to you.  He wanted to see you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He used to!  But not now!" broke despairingly
from the little figure on the wall.  "That's the worst
of it!  To begin with, he&mdash;he did like me!  I was almost
sure of it!  But not since that girl came down here
to take him from me!"
</p>

<p>
"Which girl?"
</p>

<p>
In a tone of passionate despair Elizabeth pronounced
the name.
</p>

<p>
"Muriel Elvey!"
</p>

<p>
"Muriel&mdash;oh, my dear girl, no.  That's absurd."
</p>

<p>
But nothing would persuade Elizabeth that it wasn't
true.  She had seen Muriel, who was so lovely that every
man must fall in love with her.  She had seen her at
the concert, where Colonel Fielding was talking to her
every minute that he was not singing.  She'd seen her
at the Tests, still with Colonel Fielding in attendance.
She, Miss Elvey, was staying at The Lodge, where
Colonel Fielding was also staying.  Oh!  Elizabeth
knew what would happen.
</p>

<p>
I wished I did!  Personally, I thought it very
unlikely that Muriel meant to look at Colonel Fielding;
but was she going to marry her host, Captain Holiday?
In the meantime she was causing the bitterest jealousy
to both me and my poor little chum!
</p>

<p>
To think that this was Elizabeth who had strafed me
about fretting over what any young man had said or
done!
</p>

<p>
"I wish I hadn't come," she mourned; "and now it
will almost kill me to go."
</p>

<p>
Here she stopped, starting as if shot.  She lifted
her head from her knees and sprang off the low wall.
</p>

<p>
There had been a rustling of the leaves that I'd
thought was the breeze; but Elizabeth had heard and
recognized the light footstep that accompanied that
rustling.
</p>

<p>
Another moment and there appeared before us the
slim figure and half-girlish face of the man who was the
cause of all this agitation.
</p>

<p>
I looked hard at him as he saluted and said "How
do you do?"
</p>

<p>
He blushed&mdash;yes, he had that trick of blushing which
camouflages some of the effrontery of some of the least
diffident of men.  I realized now that it was all a
"put-on"&mdash;his quietness, his nervousness, his seeming
shyness.
</p>

<p>
"Er&mdash;er&mdash;I'm so glad I happened to come across
you," he said.  "The fact is I've something I&mdash;I
rather wanted to ask you&mdash;you two people."
</p>

<p>
How deprecatingly he spoke, but what a gleam of
mischief there was behind those ridiculously long lashes
of his!  What did he really mean?
</p>

<p>
I saw him again as I'd seen him at that concert,
dressed up in that successful imitation of a Spanish
beauty, singing in a contralto that would have lured
the bird from the tree, taking in half the audience by
his mock "glad eye" at Captain Holiday, and finally
tossing that red flower into the little brown paw of the
Land Girl whom he most admired.  Not too milk-and-watery,
all that!  And as Elizabeth herself defended
him later, "It's not by being namby-pamby that a man
gets the D.S.O."  In spite of his distressingly&mdash;to
me&mdash;pretty-pretty appearance, there were depths in
this idol of Elizabeth's.
</p>

<p>
Now what had he come to say?
</p>

<p>
"Er," he began, "I've heard you finished your
training and are going away from here."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we're off on Monday," Elizabeth said quite
steadily.
</p>

<p>
He tapped against a moss-covered stick with his
cane, and went on, as if shyly:
</p>

<p>
"Er&mdash;Holiday told me something of the sort.  Do&mdash;do
you like the job you're going to?"
</p>

<p>
"We don't know yet," said I, cheerfully enough.
"I expect we shall."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Holiday didn't know&mdash;that is, I expect Holiday
might be rather annoyed if he thought I'd said
anything to you about this," returned this maddeningly
puzzling young man.  "But, still, it was an idea of his.
And&mdash;er&mdash;I don't see how he could find out if he didn't
ask you himself, do you?"
</p>

<p>
Together Elizabeth and I demanded, "Ask us what?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Holiday wondered if you two would care to
stay on at the farm," suggested Captain Fielding.
</p>

<p>
I saw Elizabeth's head go up.
</p>

<p>
"Stay on?" I echoed.  "But we've finished our training!"
</p>

<p>
"Er&mdash;yes.  But the Prices want two more land-workers to
take the places of two more men they've had
called up.  And Holiday thought that&mdash;er&mdash;since
they're pleased with you, and you've got through the
exam.&mdash;well, it could be managed," concluded Colonel
Fielding, diffidently.  "It depends upon whether you'd
like to stay on jobs there.  Would you?"
</p>

<p>
Here was a question!
</p>

<p>
To go&mdash;or to stay on?
</p>

<p>
In less time than it takes you to read about it I'd
revolved it rapidly in my own mind as I stood there by
that wall under the hazels, glancing from Elizabeth
to the young officer who had made the suggestion.
</p>

<p>
To go meant good-bye to so many things I'd come
to care for.  Good-bye to the Prices, the gentle giant
and his dainty wife, to whom her silvered hair gave
the look of a little French marquise; good-bye to their
kindliness and interest&mdash;not every land-worker finds
employers as helpful and as considerate.  However
charming the Rectory people might turn out to be I
could not hope that they would come up to these kind
people.
</p>

<p>
It meant good-bye to the Practice Farm, of which
I'd become attached to every field, every distant view,
every shed&mdash;even the celebrated cow-house that I'd
cleaned out on that first morning!  Good-bye to the
merry midday meals in the jolly kitchen!  Good-bye
to the dear old white mare, and the cows who now knew
me well!  Good-bye to the morning tramp to work
through the dew-spangled, ferny lanes!  Good-bye, too,
to the life in camp; good-bye to Vic, the irresistible
Cockney, to Sybil, and little Peggy with her "I'm
astonished at you!"&mdash;to Curley, to the red-haired
Aggie with her rich Welsh voice, and to the young
forewoman who had mothered the whole mixed lot of us!
</p>

<p>
We had been one big family; I had found sisters of
every class and kind.  Now I had to leave them all,
after sharing their life and their hearts, for six
unforgettable weeks.  To part&mdash;with the chance that we
should never meet again!  It's the fate that breaks up
so many a cheery mess, both in the Army and the Land
Army!  To go meant all this.
</p>

<p>
But to stay meant, for me, seeing Captain Holiday
still.  How could I grow to forget him and thrust him
out of my mind, as I hoped, if I knew that round any
corner I should meet him still, the golden-and-white
collie trailing at his heels?  How could I grow resigned
and philosophical, and all those things which I meant to
be, if I had the constant pain of seeing him with Muriel?
(The Elveys, by the way, seemed to be staying on
indefinitely at the Lodge.)  Oh, I thought that to stay
was the very worst thing I could do for myself!
</p>

<p>
But then I hadn't only myself to think about.
</p>

<p>
At the very sound of the words "stay on" I'd seen
Elizabeth's small face lighted up as if by a ray of
sunshine from within.  She'd turned it hastily away again.
But well I knew what her sentiments were!
</p>

<p>
So I decided in an instant.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  If it could be arranged!  Of course we'd both
prefer to stay on here.  We'll stay!" I said, without
hesitating.
</p>

<p>
Enormous relief appeared in the very tilt of Elizabeth's
Board of Agriculture hat.  As for the young
Colonel&mdash;what did he think or feel?  Was he interested
in my little infatuated chum, or wasn't he?  Was
he just another slave at the chariot wheels of the
all-conquering Muriel?  And what had he said to Captain
Holiday about our staying here?  Or had it been the
other young man's idea?  Afterwards I wondered very
much about this.
</p>

<p>
Why had Captain Holiday thought of us?  The
Practice Farm was on his land but what had the actual
working of it got to do with him, he being merely down
in this part of the country on sick leave like his friend,
Colonel Fielding?
</p>

<p>
Further, I wondered how much longer Muriel and her
mother would be here, and when the coy, uncertain, and
hard-to-please Muriel would make up her mind whom
she wanted to marry?

CHAPTER XXII
<br><br>
HAY-HARVEST
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Go see the wholesome country girls make hay,<br>
  Whose brown hath lovelier grace<br>
  Than many a painted face,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I do know<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyde Park can show."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
All these questions were still there, unanswered,
a fortnight later.
</p>

<p>
That date found Elizabeth and me settled as
permanent Land-workers under our friend Mr. Price,
but still living in camp, whence we walked to our work.
It found Curley gone; she had taken the Rectory job;
Sybil, too, was away.  She had got the post of gardening
girl at a country house outside Careg that supplied
the hospital with extra vegetables.  The Elveys were
still at the Lodge, for poor Mrs. Elvey had had a
rheumatic attack and could not move.  Very probably,
thought I with a pang, Miss Muriel did not want to
move!
</p>

<p>
All this marked the date of the beginning of one of
the farm's biggest days&mdash;the gathering in of the
second hay crop.
</p>

<p>
I shall never forget this as one of the greatest
scrambles that I've ever rushed through.  A "thick
day" at the office was nothing to it!
</p>

<p>
It was intensely hot.  The sky was cloudless, not
blue, but a sultry mauve.
</p>

<p>
Now at dinner-time Mr. Price strode in on his
inordinately long legs that he had given no rest since
early morn; his blue eyes were alert and excited.
</p>

<p>
"The glass is going down," he said.  "And I heard
thunder beyond the town.  I'll tell you what.  I believe
it'll be a race between a big storm&mdash;and us getting in
that field of hay!"
</p>

<p>
Little Mrs. Price lifted her tiny, dignified face as she
sat at table.
</p>

<p>
"We'll have to do it then," said she.  "Everybody
will help."
</p>

<p>
"Everybody it'll have to be," declared Mr. Price,
dispatching his dinner full speed ahead.  "Everybody
on the farm.  And I'll see if some of the wounded boys
can take a hand.  And you get every one of the workmen's
wives, too.  Tell them to leave their washing,
leave their baking, bring their babies to the corner of
the field and all come!"
</p>

<p>
Off went Mrs. Price to mobilize these volunteers.  Out
we dashed&mdash;the Regulars.
</p>

<p>
It was indeed all hands to the pumps&mdash;that breathless
afternoon.
</p>

<p>
The big field seemed to hold half Careg; farm hands,
old men, boys in hospital blue, rosy-faced women in
sun-bonnets&mdash;these last were the workmen's wives whom
Mrs. Price had fetched.  They worked like niggers.
And as we toiled the air grew more breathless; the pale
mauve of the sky deepened to an angry indigo, and far
away we heard a muttering of thunder.  The storm was
gathering slowly.
</p>

<p>
I felt myself becoming part of a regiment, part of a
willing machine that walked quickly down the rows
raking the fragrant swathes.
</p>

<p>
Should we do it?  Should we get in that hay in time,
beat the on-rolling field-grey clouds that were coming
up, massed like German divisions?
</p>

<p>
It was exciting.  It was for the moment the most
important thing in the world that that field should be
cleared before the thunder-rain came on to spoil all.
</p>

<p>
I raked, handling the rake with ease and rhythm;
I scarcely realized who walked just in front of me, or
that the two shirt-sleeved figures&mdash;one with an
absurdly slim waist!&mdash;were Captain Holiday and Colonel
Fielding.
</p>

<p>
Steadily the storm was coming up, but steadily we
worked.
</p>

<p>
"We shall do it!" declared little Mrs. Price, as she
passed me once, "we shall have time for tea and all!"
</p>

<p>
Presently, as I raked in front of the road-gate, I saw
our organizing secretary fling herself off her bicycle and
run up.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Price!" she called.  "What can I do to help?"
</p>

<p>
"Cut bread and butter if you like!" laughed the
farmer's wife.  "It's tea-time, and we've earned it!
I'm just going to bring out a white cloth and two big
loaves, and a huge bowl of butter, and the kettle, and
tea in bags!  Yes, come on!"
</p>

<p>
Twenty minutes later the last load of hay was
carried.  The haymakers sat down on the grass
in the corner of the field to feast their achievement,
farmfolk groups and little clusters, friends, families
together.  Mr. Price seated himself in triumph on
the cutter, waving a cup at the threatening purple
skies.
</p>

<p>
"We've done it!" he cried.  "We have, indeed!"
</p>

<p>
I had cast myself down in the nearest shady patch,
had thrown off my hat, and dried my streaming forehead.
Life was extraordinarily good at that moment;
I felt it surging in fulness through every vein.  I was
heated and spent for the instant; but how happy!
Work is an anodyne; but it must be the right kind of
work.  This had been splendid.  I'd forgotten
everything else!
</p>

<p>
I stuffed my handkerchief into my sleeve, and came
to myself to find that in my shady corner I was one of
a group of four.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth had thrown herself down close beside me.
Next to her the slim Colonel had sat down.  Opposite
to me, holding out bread and butter on a large burdock
leaf, was Captain Holiday.
</p>

<p>
The quartette of us devoured our tea together with
an enjoyment which was, as Captain Holiday presently
said through a mouthful, barely decent!
</p>

<p>
"Why?" demanded Colonel Fielding, with that misleading
diffidence of his.  "Why shouldn't we&mdash;er&mdash;enjoy
this?  I&mdash;I may tell you that this"&mdash;he drank
more tea, reached for another hunk of bread and butter,
and looked sideways at Elizabeth&mdash;"this is going to
represent one of the meals of my life!"
</p>

<p>
I said, rather tritely, "That's because you worked so
hard for it!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;er&mdash;no.  I don't think I like anything I've
deserved," said this young man, with (outward)
mildness.  Much faith I put in that as he began on his
fourth hunk, eating by tiny mouthfuls as he must have
been taught in the nursery.  "Anything one's earned
makes one feel&mdash;er&mdash;one doesn't want it any more.
At least, I feel like that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not often, my dear chap," put in his friend, Captain
Holiday, brusquely.  "If you were dependent upon
what you earned or deserved&mdash;by gad, you would be
fairly destitute!"
</p>

<p>
Now it always amuses me the way in which men will
show warm regard for a special chum by insulting him
in public.  But Elizabeth, over her white japanned mug
of tea, shot a really furious glance at the man who
had dared to say this thing to her idol!
</p>

<p>
Colonel Fielding just laughed through those eyelashes,
nodded good-naturedly at his friend, and took
up the conversation again as he lounged on the grass.
</p>

<p>
Hoping for Elizabeth's sake that what he said might
tell something about him, I prepared to listen to every
word of it!

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII
<br><br>
COLONEL FIELDING DISCUSSES "ENJOYMENT"
</h3>

<p>
Now, as we sat in that field, between the blond
stubble and lowering purple sky, there was
one thing the others didn't guess.
</p>

<p>
I wouldn't have changed places with a Queen.  Just
to be so near Captain Holiday, rested and feasting
after work, was sheer joy to me.  He would never know.
</p>

<p>
But it was odd to find his friend, Colonel Fielding,
suddenly putting my thoughts into words!
</p>

<p>
He repeated his own words of a moment before.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, this is one of 'the' feasts," he said softly.
"Tea and bread and butter in a hayfield.
And&mdash;er&mdash;absolutely topping.  It's Enjoyment; pukka.  It's
what people are always chasing.  They flock to&mdash;er&mdash;the
most expensive restaurants in town for this.
They go on to boxes at theatres, supper clubs.  It's
what they order champagne for.  Jazz bands.  Dressing
up to the nines.  All to get it!  They&mdash;er&mdash;they
don't get it," murmured the young Colonel, in his
meekest of meek voices.  "You can't buy it.  It comes to
you&mdash;or it doesn't.  Fact."
</p>

<p>
Nobody said anything.  Fielding continued:
</p>

<p>
"When people look back on the best time they've
ever had, they don't find that those are the times
that&mdash;er&mdash;that have swallowed up every stiver at Cox's.
No.  Nor the times when they set out deliberately to do
themselves well, and&mdash;er&mdash;dash the expense.  No!
As often as not, <i>that</i> is a wash-out.  Er&mdash;I don't
know why.  But somehow the best time nearly always
comes down to something that costs hardly anything."
</p>

<p>
Captain Holiday, smoking, gave a sort of non-committal
grunt.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Elizabeth was listening spellbound to the
homily on Life's Good Times, given by the young officer,
who talked as if he were the shyest of the shy&mdash;but
whose shyness did not stop him from holding forth.
</p>

<p>
"A woman once told me," the Colonel began again.
</p>

<p>
Here I saw Elizabeth prick up her ears even more, if
possible!
</p>

<p>
The Colonel saw it too.  The smile he gave might
have been the smile of some coquette who, deliberately
"playing" her lover, sees him "rise."  Ah, if Elizabeth
looked like that Princess who on her bridal-night
was metamorphosed into a lad, this slim Colonel might
have been the bridegroom who, to keep her love, was
bewitched in turn into becoming a Princess....
</p>

<p>
He went on:
</p>

<p>
"Yes, a woman who's taught me rather a lot about
women once told me that the most delightful lunch of
her life was&mdash;er&mdash;was in a poisonous little musty
coffee-room of a country pub."
</p>

<p>
Here Captain Holiday put in: "What induced you
to take her <i>there</i>?"
</p>

<p>
A gleam of mischief behind the Colonel's lashes, but
no reply to this.
</p>

<p>
"It was stuffy with the smell of bygone chops," he
enlarged dreamily.  "It was hung with huge dark
oil-paintings of spaniels, and horses, and wild duck and
things, and there were umpteen hulking sauceboats on
each sideboard; all very plated and dirty&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"How fascinating," snapped Elizabeth.
</p>

<p>
"The table decorations," pursued Colonel Fielding,
"were five napkins arranged as mitres and a tall 'fluted
ruby' glass vase full of dead daffodils&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"May one ask what the unfortunate lady was given
to eat?"
</p>

<p>
"She was given cold ham, Miss Weare, tinned apricots,
and black Indian tea at three o'clock in the
afternoon&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"How extraordinarily nasty," sniffed Elizabeth,
obviously wrung with jealousy of the woman who had thus
lunched.
</p>

<p>
Deprecatingly, Colonel Fielding smiled.  "This
woman told me," he said, "that she knew now what
was meant by the expression 'A Priceless Binge.'  It
was that lunch.  She would not have exchanged a
crumb of it for two years of living at the Ritz."
</p>

<p>
How well I understood that woman's point of view!
I opened my mouth to say so; then I saw that Captain
Holiday, leaning up on his elbow on the grass, was
watching me hard behind a cloud of smoke.
</p>

<p>
Why?  Curiosity again?  I said nothing.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose that woman meant that the person she
was lunching with made all the difference in the world
to her?" said Elizabeth, whose small, brown paw had
been pulling quite viciously at the grass during these
last remarks, in the voice of bravado.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he replied, "I believe that she did happen
to be lunching at the time with 'the person' she cared
rather a lot about.  He was&mdash;er&mdash;an old love or
something she hadn't seen for ages.  At least&mdash;I think
it must have been that."
</p>

<p>
"You 'think'!" I said exasperated.  "You don't know?"
</p>

<p>
"No," returned the young Colonel, "I couldn't ask
her, could I?"
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" demanded Captain Holiday, with his
abruptness.
</p>

<p>
"How could I ask her if she didn't choose to tell
me?" Colonel Fielding answered very gently.
</p>

<p>
Here I thought there had been enough of this
hair-splitting; besides, I couldn't bear to see Elizabeth's
afternoon being spoilt.
</p>

<p>
So, bluntly and directly, I blurted out:
</p>

<p>
"But, Colonel Fielding, wasn't it you that this
woman was having lunch with when she said that?"
</p>

<p>
"I?"  He opened his eyes at me just as Muriel might
have done, and I thought exasperatedly what a lot of
girl's tricks he had.  Still, one girl adored him for them.
I saw poor Elizabeth sitting there doing it at that moment.
</p>

<p>
"I?" he said.  "Oh, no.  I&mdash;er&mdash;wasn't there,
that time.  I wasn't&mdash;the fact is I wasn't born.  My
mother only told me about it lately."
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth stopped pulling up the stubble with a jerk,
and at the same moment I said sharply, "Your mother&mdash;but
what's your mother got to do with it, Colonel
Fielding?"
</p>

<p>
"She was the woman who had lunch," explained the
young man simply.  "She&mdash;er&mdash;is the woman who's
taught me most things, I think.  I always think men
might learn more from their mothers than any other
woman allows 'em to&mdash;er&mdash;know.  '<i>You'll get a
sweetheart any day, but not anothah mothah!</i>'  D'you
know that song, Miss Weare?"
</p>

<p>
Villain!  He had simply been "trying it on," "playing
up"!  He was quite "up" to the fact of Elizabeth's
jealousy.  And now he was equally "up" to the
look of exquisite relief that was lighting her up
again&mdash;just as it had done when she found she was not to go
away after all.
</p>

<p>
All this, I thought, was cruel.
</p>

<p>
I turned to Captain Holiday, who was just laughing&mdash;at
this rate I should soon change places with my
chum.  I should become the Man-Hater.  Men were
too irritating, too little worth all this trouble and
affection that we lavish upon them!
</p>

<p>
But, in the meantime, we had forgotten the storm.
Suddenly it broke out, deafeningly, over our heads.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" exclaimed Captain Holiday sharply, springing
to his feet.
</p>

<p>
We followed his example.
</p>

<p>
"Here it is," he cried.  "The storm!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV
<br><br>
STORM
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Lightning may come, straight rains and tiger sky."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;MEREDITH.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I turned up my face.  Splash!  came the first
huge thunder drop upon it.
</p>

<p>
"Run for it.  Run for the farm!" exclaimed
both the men.  I saw Colonel Fielding's slender hand
dart out and catch that sunburnt paw of Elizabeth's as
they dashed after the farmer's wife.  Hand in hand
they ran over the field like children, laughing like
children too&mdash;and I knew this would be another of "THE"
moments of life to my little chum.
</p>

<p>
I was legging it after them when I was stopped as if
by a shot.  From behind me there was a sharp cry.
</p>

<p>
"Joan!  Joan!"
</p>

<p>
I turned to the corner under the elms where we had
been picnicking.  Every one had left it in their dash for
cover before the rain came on.  Only Captain Holiday
was there; he stood, his back to the biggest elm, his
hands spread out behind him on the trunk, his face
ghastly white.
</p>

<p>
"Joan!" he called like a child.
</p>

<p>
I ran back to him.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?" I asked anxiously.  "Has
your knee let you down?"&mdash;I knew that one of his
wounds had been in the knee&mdash;"Where are you hurt?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not hurt," he said, and tried to smile.  "Only
I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Crashing thunder drowned his voice.  Then I saw an
odd thing happen.  His whole body seemed to shrink
and flatten itself against that tree.  He caught his
hands away from the bark and covered his face.  He
was in an agony.
</p>

<p>
I hurried to him.  He clutched my arm.
</p>

<p>
"Don't go," he muttered.  "I say, I'm mad sorry,
but I can't help it.  I thought I was right again.  I've
been like this ever since the Somme.  Those guns&mdash;I'm
afraid you'll have to stay with me.  I can't move from
here yet.  You see I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Crash! came the thunder just above us again.  He
shook as it rolled away.  Then in a whisper that seemed
torn from him I heard him say: "I'm frightened of
that."
</p>

<p>
I could have cried.  For in a flash as of the
lightning now playing above the hills I seemed to
understand all.
</p>

<p>
Shell-shock!  This healthy and normal young man
had been through every horror of war, and I knew how
bravely.  Some of the wounded soldiers at the hospital
had been in his old company; they had had plenty of
tales to tell.  He was as plucky as any lion&mdash;but he
was "done in" now.  Thunder, that brought back to
him the guns of that hell in which he had been last
wounded, found him paralysed and helpless with shock.
</p>

<p>
I took both his hands.
</p>

<p>
"I'll stay with you," I said as comfortingly as I
could.  "Come to the other side of the tree, it's
absolutely sheltered there."  I sat down, leaning against
the trunk.  "Sit down by me."
</p>

<p>
I remembered how often I had been told as a child
not to shelter under trees in a thunderstorm, but what
else was there to do?
</p>

<p>
The big warm thunder-drops, that had been coming
one by one, were now pattering faster and faster on the
leaves.  Again the thunder crashed; Captain Holiday
crouched up close to me.  I found myself slipping my
arm about his neck&mdash;he was trembling.  What else
could I do?  I heard him say "Thank you, dear."  And
he put his head down on my shoulder.  He buried
his brown face against my overall when the next crash
came.
</p>

<p>
Yes!  He clung to me for comfort as if there were no
other help for him in the world.  At that moment there
was no other.
</p>

<p>
What a half-hour!  I felt I must be dreaming.
Could it be I, Joan Matthews, Land Girl, who was
sitting there?  Yes; here was my own overalled arm round
the quite solid-feeling neck of the young man; it was my
own shoulder against which his head was refuged.  Once
I was nearly, nearly sure I felt his lips against the rough
holland of my smock&mdash;but that was a chance touch.
Once I found myself wishing wildly that the storm need
never stop, and that I could stay here like this for ever,
not moving, not speaking!
</p>

<p>
To speak would mean a drop out of the seventh
heaven and back to Britain in war-time, to a world full
of disappointments&mdash;and Muriel.
</p>

<p>
Even Muriel would never be able to take this one little
half-hour from me when I had been Dick Holiday's only
help in distress, when he had just once said "Dear"
to me; even if he hardly knew in his agitation to whom he
was speaking!
</p>

<p>
I should always have one perfect memory.
</p>

<p>
It was he who spoke first, in the lull that came after
thunder that seemed now receding.
</p>

<p>
He lifted his head at last, and said huskily:
</p>

<p>
"Joan, I'm afraid you'll think I'm the limit.  I mean
you'll never think anything of me again!  Cold feet&mdash;a
coward!"
</p>

<p>
"A coward?  You?" I retorted.
</p>

<p>
Tears rushed into my eyes again.  I was red with
conflicting emotions.
</p>

<p>
The young soldier beside me was still pale.  I looked
at his downcast face.
</p>

<p>
"You think I think you're the kind of man who gets
cold feet?" I cried.
</p>

<p>
My voice shook with reproach.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" I exclaimed, "how horrid of you to say such
a thing."
</p>

<p>
At this he sat up straight under that tree and looked
at me.  A more normal expression came over his face.
</p>

<p>
"Horrid?" he echoed.
</p>

<p>
And then in quite his own brusque, ragging voice he
declared:
</p>

<p>
"Mention any subject on earth to a woman, and she'll
always find the unexpected comment.  Always!  Anyhow,
this woman will.  I don't understand why you've
just called me 'horrid,' Joan!"
</p>

<p>
"You don't understand me at all when you think I
understand so little," I said bitterly.  "As if I didn't
realize what it meant for a man to be wrecked by
shell-shock.  As if I thought it was the same thing as his
being frightened, cowardly!  Good heavens!  As if I
didn't know how you'd behaved out in France, Captain
Holiday?"
</p>

<p>
Resentfully I wound up: "But you will persist in
thinking me a fool!" I said bitterly.
</p>

<p>
Now he was quite himself again.
</p>

<p>
"Why should I think you a fool?" he barked.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know!" I barked in return.
</p>

<p>
Staring at the now abating rain, I suggested sharply:
"Perhaps you laugh at me for being on land work at
all?"
</p>

<p>
Captain Holiday turned, looked hard at me.  I
thought he would snap again.  Instead of that he
replied gently.
</p>

<p>
"Land work?  Honestly I think it's the noblest
work women can do today."
</p>

<p>
He glanced at the hayfield, cleared only that
afternoon, gleaming under the rain.
</p>

<p>
"Cramped occupations, unhealthy city life, flat
chests, specialists' fees&mdash;all swept away!" he said
musingly.  "Land work would help us to that, you
know.  Land work would give us rosier wives, better
babies"&mdash;then he turned upon me with his abruptest
question&mdash;"I suppose you think it's odd of me to think
of such things?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not.  I agree with every word you say,"
I assured him.  "Only&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I was thinking of Muriel.  Land work and she were
as the poles apart, yet he loved her (or so I was driven
to suppose).  And yet he clung to his ideals of a
country life!
</p>

<p>
"Only&mdash;what?" he took me up.  "What were you
going to say?"
</p>

<p>
"That girl you spoke to me about the other evening,"
I said, "that girl who won't say either 'Yes' or 'No'
to you&mdash;'the' girl&mdash;what does she think about all
this?"
</p>

<p>
He paused for a moment and glanced at the sky.
</p>

<p>
Presently he turned those grey and friendly eyes of
his upon me again.  They smiled very sweetly as he
answered my question.
</p>

<p>
"She?  Oh!  She thinks as I'd like her to think."
</p>

<p>
So then I knew he must be completely under Muriel's
sway.  That lovely, super-civilized girl could "take him
in" about her views on any subject.  If she wanted
him to believe that she hated town and luxury and
only loved roughing it on the land, he would believe her.
</p>

<p>
He was all hers!
</p>

<p>
Suddenly chilled, and sore at heart, I got up.  I took
a step outside the shelter of those elms that had seen
my wonderful half-hour.  It was over, over.  All over!

<p><br></p>

<p>
"It has stopped raining," I said.  "What is the
time?"
</p>

<p>
He turned his wrist.
</p>

<p>
"A quarter past six," he said.  "You're supposed
to have knocked off?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but I expect Elizabeth is waiting at the farm.
Good-bye, Captain Holiday."
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye!"  But he was walking by my side across
the field.  "I haven't thanked you yet for being good
to me."
</p>

<p>
"Please don't."
</p>

<p>
"All right!  I won't!" said he serenely.  Striding
by my side, he came on as far as the farmyard gate.
</p>

<p>
He opened it for me.
</p>

<p>
Then, leaning on the gate, he lingered.  In quite his
old manner he launched a question.
</p>

<p>
"D'you miss town much?"
</p>

<p>
I laughed.
</p>

<p>
All about me there went up that sweet incense of
the country earth after rain; the ever-vivid colours of
the Welsh landscape were heightened to brilliance; each
twig of the hedge had its hanging diamonds.  Across
the green breast of the hill behind the farm there lay,
striped like a medal-ribbon, the end of the rainbow.
Hope and gaiety smiled from every inch of the
rain-washed country; and I echoed: "Miss town?  Not
now, thank you."
</p>

<p>
"But you did at first, Joan."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," I admitted.  "Badly."
</p>

<p>
"Then why did you ever leave it?  I've often
wondered," said Captain Holiday.  "Why did you come
away?"
</p>

<p>
I hesitated.  How could I tell him about Harry?
</p>

<p>
"It was a toss-up whether I stayed or came," I said.
</p>

<p>
Still leaning on that gate, Captain Holiday said:
"I'm glad the country won that toss."
</p>

<br>
<i>Still leaning on the gate, Captain Holiday said: &quot;I'm <br>
glad the country won that toss&quot;</i>
</p>

<p>
Sweet of him, and friendly!  But it meant no more
than mere friendliness.
</p>

<p>
I fought down a sigh.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye," I said again.
</p>

<p>
He did not move from the gate.  He just went on
with the conversation.
</p>

<p>
"So you came here; left London.  Sometimes one
hates leaving&mdash;places, I mean, of course."
</p>

<p>
I said rather bitterly, "Yes&mdash;places."
</p>

<p>
"Not people?" he took up, with a very quick tilt of
his head.
</p>

<p>
What could one say?  I agreed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, people are hard enough to leave sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"Are they?" he said, looking down at me.  I could
not meet his friendly eyes.  I moved to go on.
</p>

<p>
Then at last he took his arm from that gate and
followed me through it, shutting it behind him.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps there were people who were hard to leave in
London?"
</p>

<p>
What right had he to say it?  I was angry with him.
Considering he had his own love-story to attend to,
why should he question me still&mdash;try to find out how
love had treated me?  What business was it of his?
</p>

<p>
Temper flamed up in me.
</p>

<p>
"No!  When I left town to join up there was nobody
I minded leaving.  Else I should not have left.
The&mdash;the people I should have hated to leave had left
themselves!"
</p>

<p>
My voice grew harder as the memory of Harry Markham
surged back into my mind.  Black eyes, red tabs,
soft caressing voice that promised "all things to all
women," tender ways&mdash;how I had adored him.  And
how completely that adoration had died away now!
</p>

<p>
Oh, the unexpected things that happen in life; nearly
always in our own selves!  But I didn't intend to give
any of that away to this other young man who stood
beside me, quietly attentive to what I was saying,
outside that closed green door.
</p>

<p>
I put out my hand; but his was on the latch before
me.  He held it there as if he were just going to open
it for me.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  So 'they' had left."  He took up, in his quiet
steady voice.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said defiantly.  "If you must know, and it
seems as if you always must know everything about
everybody&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not everything," he assured me seriously, "and not
about everybody.  Only some things, and about
my&mdash;well, I can say we are friends, can't I?"
</p>

<p>
This, of course, melted me again to him.  I had to
look away, back over the yard, the cloister-like sheds,
the now-smiling country beyond.
</p>

<p>
"Friends?  Oh, yes," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Then tell me what you were going to say when you
began, 'if you must know'?"
</p>

<p>
Still looking away, I finished the sentence.
</p>

<p>
"If you must know," I said, "'they' sailed for
Salonika days before I left London."
</p>

<p>
Very quickly he said:
</p>

<p>
"That was why you left?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I admitted.
</p>

<p>
The main lines of the story were known to him now.
I didn't care.
</p>

<p>
Speaking as lightly as I could, I said:
</p>

<p>
"Well!  That's that.  D'you think you've had
enough questions answered for one day, Captain
Holiday?"
</p>

<p>
"'Dick' is my name really," he observed for the second
time that day; "and I'd like to ask one other question,
if I may.  Don't imagine that I don't know it's
neck my asking.  I do know better.  But I'm going to
ask.  Do you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Even he hesitated for a moment.  Then went on:
</p>

<p>
"Do you hear from&mdash;these people?"
</p>

<p>
"These people in Salonika?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  From him," said Captain Holiday.
</p>

<p>
There flashed into my head the thought that had I
been Muriel I should have replied neither "Yes" nor
"No" to this question.  It's the successful type of
girl who always "keeps a man guessing" about everything
she does, or means, or is.  But I was cursed from
my cradle by the fairies with the quality of truthfulness.
Out it came now.
</p>

<p>
"Write to me!  No," I replied definitely.  "Not a
line!  Not a word!  I shall never hear from him again.
I shall probably never see him again as long as I live!"
</p>

<p>
And to avoid being asked more questions on this sore
subject, I looked meaningly at Captain Holiday's hand
holding the latch of the back door.  At once he opened it.
</p>

<p>
"I want to speak to the Prices," he said, and followed
me through the slate-paved scullery into the big
light kitchen.
</p>

<p>
It seemed full as a railway station of people gathered
about the wood fire, sheltering or drying after that
storm.
</p>

<p>
On the settle a dainty but ruffled figure in pale mauve
was sitting and holding out tiny silk-stockinged feet
to the blaze; her drenched white kid shoes stood on the
range.  Muriel caught in the wet!
</p>

<p>
She turned as I came in.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, Joan; talk of angels!" she said.
</p>

<p>
Talk of angels, indeed.  My eyes had flown past her
to the man's figure standing close to the fire that lighted
up his red tabs.
</p>

<p>
There he was, the very man of whom we had been talking.
The man of whom I'd said I should never see him
again as long as I lived!
</p>

<p>
I was face to face again with Harry Markham!
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
After the first moment of blankest astonishment, I
realized that this was not so very startling after all.
</p>

<p>
Harry, here?
</p>

<p>
Well, I knew he was back from Salonika.  I knew
he had a staff job in town.  Town, after all, is still
within a day's journey from these depths of mid-Wales.
I also knew that Captain Harry Markham had always
had a bit of a reputation as "a leave-hog."  I need not
be so amazed that he had secured a week's freedom out
of that old General of his.
</p>

<p>
As to why he should spend it in Careg&mdash;well, I think
trout-stream and a jolly little inn were the explanations
that the young man offered in those first hectic
moments, filled by spasmodic hand-shaking and those
inevitable remarks of: "I say, fancy coming across
you here!" and "You're looking jolly fit," and all the
other things people say on these occasions, whether
they are thinking about them or about something totally
different, or wondering how soon they can get away.
</p>

<p>
It was a curiously mixed crowd in the Prices'
hospitable kitchen!
</p>

<p>
It was like the collections of people you sometimes
meet in a dream.  I felt as if it were some dream that
brought me there to the man whom I had adored, with
the man whom I adored now, and with the girl who had
taken them both away from me!
</p>

<p>
With very mixed feelings I let myself down on a
kitchen chair near the big grandfather clock.  I felt
as if I must be "looking," as Vic might have put it,
"all ways for daylight."  Fortunately nobody there
had much time to notice me.
</p>

<p>
There were Harry and Captain Holiday ("my
cousin, you know, whose place this is!") to be
introduced by Muriel Elvey.  (A characteristically
questioning look, here, from Captain Holiday at the new
man; at whom he stared before whilst I was shaking
hands.)
</p>

<p>
Then I watched Harry being introduced to Colonel
Fielding, who, by the way, had left Elizabeth's side and
was now sitting on the arm of the oaken settle by Muriel,
in an attitude suggesting that she, Muriel, was the only
girl to whom he'd paid any attention in his life.
Wretch!  It had wiped all the joy and sparkle out of
my chum's face once again.
</p>

<p>
Then there was more tea suggested, more cigarettes
handed round, spills lighted at that comforting blaze.
I listened, just as detachedly as if I were in the
auditorium of a theatre, to the buzz of talk that went up
around me&mdash;chatter about the hay-carrying, the
recent storm, and the weather prospects for the morrow
of which Mr. Price, looming tall against the window,
seemed rather doubtful.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Elvey's sweet little white shoes!" Mrs. Price's
cheerful voice broke in.  "Don't let them scorch.  I
do hope they are not ruined&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You will have to take to boots and leggings, yet,
Miss Elvey," demurely from the young Colonel.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, can you imagine me!" from Muriel, toasting
her mauve-silk clad toes.  "Colonel Fielding, think of
little me in those clodhopping things!  Of course, I
think it wonderful of people to wear them!" with a
glance at Elizabeth.  "I ought really to be on the Land
myself&mdash;now, why do you laugh, Mr. Price?" with a
pout at the farmer.  "I believe you think I shouldn't
be very useful!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, indeed, I don't think you would," declared the
gentle giant with an indulgent smile.  "Only ornamental!"
</p>

<p>
"How horrid of you!  I've a good mind to join up
and show you!  It's only that I can't leave mother.
But I adore the country really, don't I, Dick?  I was
longing to come and make hay.  I brought Captain
Markham out on purpose, and then the rain came and
we had to fly in here.
</p>

<p>
"If you only knew how I admired all these splendid
girls who are so brave and strong, and who simply don't
mind how they get themselves all burnt and rough for
evening dress!" declared Muriel, with a glance at me as
I sat mum.  "I should look a perfect fright!  I know
I should!" twittered Muriel, glancing at Harry.
</p>

<p>
I saw Harry smile back at Muriel as he'd often smiled
at me.  He murmured something about sunburn being
sacrilege in some cases.
</p>

<p>
Muriel laughed back.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, if you're a man you can get as burnt as
a brick and it doesn't matter," she said.  "You're so
brown I hardly knew you at the station!"  Then
casually to me: "Joan, don't you think Harry's got
frightfully much thinner and sunburnt since he went
out to Salonika?"
</p>

<p>
At that word I met Captain Holiday's clear straight
glance.
</p>

<p>
It was directly upon me.
</p>

<p>
I saw that he'd seen.  He knew!  Yes!  He'd
tumbled to it that this Captain Markham who had lately
come from Salonika was the man to whom I'd referred
as "people" that had sailed for Salonika before I left
London.
</p>

<p>
Why had I ever opened my mouth about that?
</p>

<p>
For now Dick Holiday, who was in love with Muriel,
knew the whole of my silly, humiliating little tragedy.
</p>

<p>
I felt that it was written on my face anyhow.
</p>

<p>
I turned away, wishing that the tiled kitchen floor
would swallow me up.
</p>

<p>
As I turned Elizabeth was at my elbow.
</p>

<p>
"Let's go home," she muttered forlornly.
</p>

<p>
We slipped out of the party without any leave-taking.
Silently we made our way back to camp.  And I am
sure that to hear us laughing with Miss Easton and
Vic, to see us fox-trotting together to the rowdiest
record on the Camp gramophone, you would never have
guessed that the Man-hater and I were about the most
miserable pair of girls in the Land Army that night!

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI
<br><br>
COLONEL FIELDING DISCUSSES "LOVE AND THE LIKE"
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "'Tis Love breeds love in me, and cold disdain<br>
  Kills that again."&mdash;DONNE.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
With the morning we had pulled ourselves
together again.  Not a word did Elizabeth
address to me on the subject of our having
met my old love in attendance on Muriel.  Not a
syllable did I say to her about the object of her own
misplaced affections, that finished and unscrupulous flirt,
that philanderer more accomplished than Harry&mdash;Colonel
Fielding.  The name of Captain Holiday was
not mentioned.  In fact, there might not have been
"such a thing as young men" in our world that morning.
</p>

<p>
A wet morning it had turned out!  Hay-culling
would be out of the question.  This we knew even
before we scrambled into our brown Land Army
mackintoshes and splashed away down the road.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth congratulated herself on the nice dry
indoor job that would be hers, for Mrs. Price was
going to let us take turns at helping her on baking-day,
and this was the turn of my chum.
</p>

<p>
As for me, I found that I should also be kept out
of the wet.  My morning's work was in the big shearing-shed,
turning the shearing-machine for Ivor, the
shepherd.  He held down the fat lambs on a wooden bench
set on the great black floor-sheet of tarpaulin, and went
slowly and methodically to work with a sort of twelve-pointed
clipping-knife over the body of the lamb, while
I turned the big red wheel with its belt and pipe
attached to the knife.  It was not hard work, but quite
soothing&mdash;rather like knitting!
</p>

<p>
And I was at this occupation when I had a visitor,
brought in by Mr. Price.  It was none other than
young Colonel Fielding, who asked diffidently whether
he might take a turn and give a hand either to Ivor or
Miss Matthews.
</p>

<p>
Ivor, a blond, quiet man in a dark-blue linen coat,
looked up and smiled benignantly upon this slim young
officer.  Ivor had no English, Mr. Price explained, but
he understood pretty well everything else.  Especially
everything about sheep.
</p>

<p>
"Then&mdash;er&mdash;you're lucky to have had him turned
down by the doctor, and to be able to keep him on the
farm," said Colonel Fielding.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he would make a very poor soldier," was the
Welsh farmer's verdict.  "Very reserved man; very
reserved indeed!"
</p>

<p>
Ivor smiled again as the lamb upon which he had been
operating dropped the last of his heavy coat upon the
sheet and, shaven, shorn, and freed at last, scrambled
out into the adjoining shed.
</p>

<p>
The shepherd seized another struggling and woolly
one, downed him into his place, and took up the
shearing-knife once more.
</p>

<p>
"Now," he said in Welsh, with a little nod to me, and
I continued to work the wheel.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Price in his oilskin coat had stepped out again
into the rain.  Colonel Fielding did not go with him.
He unfastened his brown, trench-worn mackintosh,
threw it on one of the big wool-sacks, and took a pace
nearer to me and my wheel.
</p>

<p>
I wondered if he had expected to see Elizabeth in the
shed.  Taking absolutely no notice of him I worked on.
</p>

<p>
"Let me have a turn, won't you?" came the meek
voice of the intruder&mdash;for I felt, as I never had with
Captain Holiday, that an intruder he was.  "You take
a rest, Miss Matthews."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, I am not in the least tired."  I said it
coldly.  I thoroughly disapproved of this young man
who had been trifling with Elizabeth's feelings.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth, bless her, was too good to be at the mercy
of this young scamp with his D.S.O. and his subtle
way of flirting so that you could hardly nail it down and
say that it was flirting at all.  Elizabeth had said hard
things of Harry, in the days of my infatuation for him.
But she hadn't thought any harder things of him than
I thought now of this slender-waisted ruffian with the
moustache that looked as if a pinch of light-gold paint
had been rubbed on to his upper lip.
</p>

<p>
Cruel hard lines that he should turn out to be the
one and only exception to Elizabeth's rule of hating
men!
</p>

<p>
In his meekest of voices he said:
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you are not tired.  But why are you
so&mdash;er&mdash;poisonously angry with me?"
</p>

<p>
Before I could reply he answered, still meekly, his
own question.
</p>

<p>
"You loathe me because you think I've been heartlessly
flirting with your little friend."
</p>

<p>
I stared!
</p>

<p>
He smiled deprecatingly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes!" he continued, "women think it takes a
woman to spot those things.  But&mdash;er&mdash;I knew.
Now I'll tell you&mdash;er&mdash;something."
</p>

<p>
He glanced towards that "reserved" man, the shepherd.
</p>

<p>
"No English, eh?" he broke off.  "I wish no servants
knew any!  By Jove, how it would simplify life
for a lot of people&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But what did you want to tell me?" I said crossly.
</p>

<p>
"Just this," replied Colonel Fielding, with his most
deceptive, most shrinking bashfulness.  "I'm going to
marry your little friend, Miss Weare."
</p>

<p>
"To marry Miss Weare?"
</p>

<p>
You can imagine how I stared afresh at this.  In
fact, I stopped turning the wheel.
</p>

<p>
Deftly taking the handle from me, Colonel Fielding
began turning it in my place rhythmically, easily.  I
stood there beside him, watching him blankly.
</p>

<p>
I remembered Elizabeth's forlorn mood of last night.
I went back to her, as I'd seen her this morning,
turning to the kitchen, where she was to help Mrs. Price
bake.  Her small face under its thick crop had been set
with the determination to let work drive away trouble.
For trouble, I knew, had been as heavy at her heart as
it was at my own.  Then was all that altered already?
</p>

<p>
"What!" I exclaimed.  "You've seen her this morning?"
</p>

<p>
His eyes under their long lashes did not leave the
turning-wheel.  He only said gently:
</p>

<p>
"No, I haven't seen her this morning."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;&mdash;" I exclaimed.  I knew he could not have
seen her last night after we got back to camp.
</p>

<p>
"You haven't even asked her yet?" I said.
</p>

<p>
"No," he agreed.  "I haven't asked her yet."  And
he went on turning that big red wheel as if he were a
Fate in khaki.  After half a dozen turns he added,
"But I am going to marry her, for all that."
</p>

<p>
Rebukefully I said, "You mean you're going to
marry her if she'll have you?"
</p>

<p>
"She will have me," he said gently, but firmly.  He
blushed a little, but the girlish blushes that this young
man went in for never seemed to make the faintest
difference to his cheek&mdash;in another sense.  "She'll have
me.  I know that."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know that?" I retorted, sitting there
on that sack, and hardly knowing whether I were more
glad on Elizabeth's account, or more indignant or more
puzzled by this young man of hers.
</p>

<p>
He answered: "I know, because I know the&mdash;er&mdash;the
kind of man I am myself." ... Here he looked up,
shyly, from that wheel, and said, "Miss Matthews, you
think I'm&mdash;er&mdash;the last word in fatuous conceit."
</p>

<p>
I was thinking so.  How could I help it after what
he had just said?
</p>

<p>
"Er&mdash;I'd hate you to think that.  You are her pal.
I&mdash;er&mdash;owe you an explanation.  Please forgive me
if I talk to you for a bit just about myself&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I put in "That's a thing all men do."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  But&mdash;er&mdash;all men don't ask you to forgive
them first, do they?" he said very quickly.  "Generally
they yarn on and on and on, imagining a woman
must be jolly interested to hear it.  They don't realize
that the woman (unless she happens to be wildly in
love with them), the woman's&mdash;er&mdash;mostly thinking
of something miles away all the time!"
</p>

<p>
I couldn't help smiling.  To hear a man himself say
such a thing!  It sounded more like something
Elizabeth herself might give out.
</p>

<p>
He said, "You have forgiven me?  Well, I'll tell
you why I know Miss Weare will have me.  If she were
not attracted enough for that, I should not be attracted.
You see I am talking&mdash;er&mdash;quite frankly; no camouflage
at all.  Unless a girl liked me, I shouldn't begin
to seek her.  Not after the first look.  I must be liked,"
he said very simply and with that blush, but very
definitely, "I must feel that I am wanted."
</p>

<p>
He seemed to me extraordinary, from what I knew of
men.  I said, "But, Colonel Fielding, men always
prefer a girl who doesn't seem to want to have anything
to say to them!  They say men want the chase!"
</p>

<p>
"I can't help a lot of the silly conventional things
people say," he declared blandly.  "Er&mdash;I suppose
those things are true enough about people who are all
alike, like a flock of sheep."  Here he nodded towards
the lamb which had just sprung out of Ivor's hands, and
had made off to join his shorn brethren.  "But I
say&mdash;er&mdash;what I feel myself."
</p>

<p>
I looked at him doubtfully, the graceful creature
whom I personally could not admire.
</p>

<p>
He said, "It wouldn't amuse me to try to make&mdash;er&mdash;love
to anybody unless I felt that it would amuse
them too, and&mdash;er&mdash;delight them!"
</p>

<p>
I objected, "But that's a woman's point of view."
</p>

<p>
"Why only a woman's?" asked the young soldier
mildly, turning his wheel.  "I learnt it from my
mother.  The woman's view!  I find it useful to look
at&mdash;er&mdash;Love and the like.  '<i>Two things greater
than all things are, the first is Love and the next is
War.</i>'  The average man has made good on War, these
last four years.  But&mdash;er&mdash;I don't listen to him
much on Love."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I don't think the average man makes a
success of it," declared this puzzling creature coolly.
"Give a kid of two a violin to play; what?  I think
he (the average man) could learn plenty from the
average woman&mdash;on that one subject.  It's with her
my sympathies are, Miss Matthews....  Of course I
talk too much....  And now you'll call me effeminate."
</p>

<p>
His face wore a mask of harmless politeness with a
gleam behind his lashes as I looked at him.  Effeminate?
With that striped ribbon on his breast, with his colonelcy
at twenty-six, with all the praise and devotion of
his men?  These things are not won by effeminates.
</p>

<p>
He was a man all right, even if he did say and think
things which we imagine are exclusively feminine.  He
was a puzzling exception.  And even if he were the kind
of man whom I could never have loved I was beginning
to like him.
</p>

<p>
Without replying to his remark about effeminacy, I
smiled and got up.
</p>

<p>
"Let me take a turn," I said.
</p>

<p>
I took the handle of the wheel from him and began
to work.  He sat down on the wool-sack that I had left.
And even as we changed places something else changed
between us.
</p>

<p>
He realized it, as I did.
</p>

<p>
"We shall be friends now," he said very quickly and
gently.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I nodded.
</p>

<p>
"They say&mdash;your dear 'They'!&mdash;that there's no
such thing as Platonic friendship.  Here's the one
exception," he told me.  "Where all the Love goes
elsewhere.  You know you think I'm utterly unattractive.
But you want to listen to me.  As a matter of fact,
you'll never talk to a <i>fianc√©</i>, Miss Matthews, as freely
as you'll talk to me."
</p>

<p>
"Never," I agreed.
</p>

<p>
"Nor shall I ever jaw like this, to Elizabeth." ... He
broke off and said affectionately, "You're such a
pal to her!"
</p>

<p>
"She is to me."
</p>

<p>
"I know," he said.  "I knew it before I saw you two
girls.  It spoke out of her letters to me from the flat.
You know, when I got her letters, I&mdash;er&mdash;wanted to
see her!"
</p>

<p>
"They were mostly about the kitchen sink," I said,
laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that's what she told me when I told her she put
herself into her letters," said the man whom we had
called "the old Colonel" in those days.  "Somehow I
made up my mind that this girl I'd never seen would
be different from&mdash;er&mdash;most girls.  I came down
here, you know, to look.  And then&mdash;when I caught
sight of her by that cart in the field&mdash;looking such a
little picture!&mdash;I could have caught her up then and
there!"
</p>

<p>
"I wonder you weren't discouraged; she was chilling
enough that morning!"
</p>

<p>
"No," he denied.  "I felt she didn't mean that.
That was just the first minute when she had realized I
was that distasteful creature a man, and yet that she
didn't dislike the look of me."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  She's told you she hates men."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we've had all that," he admitted, "and I explained
to her that I ought to understand, because, as
a rule, I don't like girls."
</p>

<p>
Here I lifted my head and looked severely at this humbug.
</p>

<p>
"You?  Not like girls!" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Not usually," he persisted, smiling at me.  "I think
they're too little."
</p>

<p>
"Little?  But you are in love with Elizabeth.  And
Elizabeth's tiny!"
</p>

<p>
"Elizabeth," he repeated, and I heard him give a
little laugh of delight over the name of the beloved.
"Elizabeth has a heart as big as the earth!  I
was&mdash;er&mdash;talking of hearts, natures, minds.  So often girls
make me feel their minds are rather narrow," confessed
this odd type of woman-hater.
</p>

<p>
"Petty, you know," he went on.  "Saying&mdash;er&mdash;things
about other women&mdash;oh, brrrr!  Spiteful to
their own sex.  Then being decent and jolly enough
with&mdash;er&mdash;us.  <i>That</i> puts me off; by Jove, nothing
worse!  I can say all this to you, Miss Matthews.
You're different; like her.  But lots of girls make me
feel they&mdash;they&mdash;&mdash;  Well, not enough cold tub!"
he wound up ingenuously, "and too much face-powder!"
</p>

<p>
The last words brought a certain image into my
mind; exquisitely-dressed, scented, powdered Muriel!
</p>

<p>
Thinking of yesterday, I said to the young man,
"You're very severe on girls, but I saw you when you
were flirting outrageously with one&mdash;no, not with
Elizabeth.  With Miss Elvey."
</p>

<p>
"To see if it annoyed Elizabeth!" he admitted, so
frankly that I had to laugh over my work.
</p>

<p>
I said: "Now that was feminine enough!  That
was 'little'!  Anybody would have imagined that you
were very much attracted.  In fact, I thought you were."
</p>

<p>
"Attracted?  To Miss Elvey?" he cried out as if
I'd said something too wildly improbable.  "I?  To
her?  Of all the girls on this earth?"
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" I asked, surprised.  "Nearly every
man is!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but I couldn't possibly be&mdash;er&mdash;attracted
to Muriel Elvey!" he declared, vigorously shaking that
small golden head of his.  "Oh, no.  Not to her!  I
know too much!"
</p>

<p>
"You hardly know her at all.  You've only met
twice."
</p>

<p>
"I know a great deal about her," declared young
Colonel Fielding, impressively.  "Not about this girl
personally, perhaps.  But about her kind."
</p>

<p>
He got up off the sack with an air of "that finishes
it."
</p>

<p>
Deeply interested, since this was Dick Holiday's pal
speaking of Dick Holiday's lady-love, I asked: "What
do you mean by 'her kind'?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you some day," the young man promised me,
getting into his Burberry again.  "I could tell
you&mdash;er&mdash;yards!  And I will.  Only I am afraid there
isn't time just now.  I promised to meet old Dick at
the bridge at eleven, by Jove.  I must tear myself away.
Good-bye.  I say, I am glad we had this&mdash;er&mdash;little
talk."
</p>

<p>
"Little talk" was good!  His tongue had been
going at least as fast as the shearing-wheel, or as the
clipping-knife in Ivor's hand.
</p>

<p>
As he nodded to the shepherd and saluted me, I said,
in a tone more cheerily friendly than I'd ever thought
I should use to him, "Wait, wait; do stop a minute!
This is all very well, Colonel Fielding, but when are
you going to have that other little talk?"
</p>

<p>
"Which other?" he asked, standing, a graceful
black silhouette, in the opening of the shearing-shed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you know!  What a young Pretender you are,
always!" I cried, half laughing.  "I mean when are
you going to speak about this, to her?"
</p>

<p>
He looked down, tilting his head sideways in a
characteristic pose he had, lashes down, a gleam of small
white teeth showing between the parted lips under the
Avenue-gold smudge that he called a moustache.  Oh,
he was much too like a coloured advertisement for
Burberry's!  Still, it was Elizabeth's choice.  I was
thankful that she was going to be happy with it.  Only,
when?
</p>

<p>
He said, laughing, "What a staunch little friend
you are to her!  You even go as far as to&mdash;er&mdash;ask
people their 'intentions' about her....  Miss
Matthews, you'll be the first person we shall tell!"
</p>

<p>
Now what did he mean?
</p>

<p>
In spite of his caring, genuinely, was he going to
keep his love guessing a little longer?
</p>

<p>
"Do you think," he said teasingly to me, "that I
ought to go off and bother her with this&mdash;er&mdash;on
the nail?  In the middle of whatever job she's on?  I
don't knew where she is?"
</p>

<p>
He was answered&mdash;as he deserved.
</p>

<p>
Not by me!
</p>

<p>
It was that "reserved man," Ivor the shepherd,
reputed to speak only his own language, who suddenly
took us both aback.
</p>

<p>
Lifting his head from his shearing, the Welshman
put in, in his pleasant up-and-down accent, "You
looking for that other lady, sir?  Miss Weare?  I do
think it is in the kitchen!"
</p>

<p>
Here was a bit of a shock.
</p>

<p>
The young Colonel and I had been chatting so freely,
so confidentially!  Imagining ourselves quite
uncomprehended, we had literally forgotten the presence of
the silent, blue-jacketed Welsh shepherd, who knelt there
busily shearing, while one of us turned the wheel and
both of us talked....  How we had talked, to be sure!
</p>

<p>
And Ivor had not only heard; he had followed the
conversation!
</p>

<p>
This was what he sprung upon us now!  Consternation!
The blankest of awkward pauses!
</p>

<p>
Then Colonel Fielding, biting that golden morsel of a
moustache, cleared his throat, turned to the shepherd,
and said coldly and with as much dignity as could be
lent to an obviously foolish remark, "I thought you
didn't know any English?"
</p>

<p>
Ivor blinked mildly back at the officer and answered:
"'Deed, I not know only very little, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I expect you all know a great deal more than
you&mdash;er&mdash;give out, you Welsh!" declared Colonel Fielding,
half-exasperated, half-amused.  "That's how you get
on in the world, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir?" said Ivor, with a pleasant, puzzled smile.
</p>

<p>
Impossible to tell whether he understood or not!  We
should never know, either, how much of the talk we'd had
had been eagerly taken in by him!  All of it?  We
couldn't exactly ask him!  Colonel Fielding glanced at
me with a half-humorous little shrug.  The same
thought struck us both at the same minute.
</p>

<p>
One thing was pretty certain.  Very shortly Ivor
would retail to Mrs. Ivor in fluent Welsh everything that
he had understood of our English.  In that gossipy
little nest which was Careg, gaping for any crumb of
news, it would very soon be all over the place that
Colonel Fielding was to marry "that little young lady
that's working for Mr. Price"!  Yes; by midday it
would be proclaimed.  It would run like wildfire up to
the Hospital and down to the Land Girls' Camp.
Everybody would know!  Before Elizabeth herself knew!
</p>

<p>
I could not help laughing at the dismayed face of
young Colonel Fielding as he stood there, frowning, the
wind taken out of his sails.  It did serve him right!
Mischievous as he was, and full of guile and wile and
teasing, sheltering himself behind that pretence of
shyness, he found his match in this Welshman who put up
that bluff of ignorance!  The game was to Ivor the
shepherd, who did understand English after all....
</p>

<p>
But Colonel Fielding trumped that.  He turned to me
and remarked: "I am going to find her now, at once."
</p>

<p>
And he said it in rapid French!
</p>

<p>
With which he left me to my soothing mechanical
work in the shearing-shed.
</p>

<p>
I watched his figure (waisted as if he wore corsets
always, though to do him justice he never did except
for his masquerades) disappear across the farmyard to
the red-brick house.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII
<br><br>
A KITCHEN COURTSHIP
</h3>

<p>
For the rest of the morning, turning steadily
away at that wheel, I found myself wondering
rather wistfully how things were going in there.
</p>

<p>
In spirit I saw the whole setting for this love-scene.
Mrs. Price's back-kitchen with the big table, where she
"put up" the dough for baking, set under the latticed
window.  The huge, hive-shaped "batch-oven" where
I myself had helped with the baking last week.  That
oven had to be heated, early, by filling it with a stack
of brushwood (some quite big boughs), setting the
stack on fire, and leaving it so until the wood was
powdery-ash, and the bricks of the domed oven-roof
were white-hot.  Then in went the loaves which
Mrs. Price's tiny expert hands had shown us how to knead
and to put up!
</p>

<p>
They&mdash;Mrs. Price and Elizabeth&mdash;had reached this
stage of the morning's work by the time Colonel Fielding
made his appearance in search of the girl he'd decided
to marry.
</p>

<p>
What happened I heard something of later.  (Not
all.)  Partly from Elizabeth, partly from him.
</p>

<p>
An odd courtship; so entirely War-time and modern!
Yet going back hundreds of years; for what
could be more old-fashioned than for the young man to
seek his love among the warmth and the fragrance and
the homely domesticity of the kitchen on baking-day!
There was little Mrs. Price in her crisp grey
overall with an old ivory brooch at her throat, busy and
brisk and looking with every inch of herself "a Lady"
in every sense, including that of the original Saxon
"Loaf-ward."  There was my chum Elizabeth helping
her.  With her hat off and her short thick hair rumpled
about her small flushed face I expect she looked like a
rather defiantly conscientious cherub!
</p>

<p>
To them, enter Colonel Fielding (with his blush!)
telling Mrs. Price (with his usual shy charm of
manner!) that he thought he'd like to come and help her,
since he understood she'd got a busy day on.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Price, demurely: "It will be a wonder if the
farm doesn't prosper this year, considering the amount
of help we are getting from the Army!  It's very good
of you, I'm sure.  The bread is all into the tins now,
Elizabeth?  That's right; perhaps the Colonel will help
you put them into the oven with this."
</p>

<p>
She gave him the immensely long-handled oven-shovel.
On this Elizabeth set loaf after loaf in the tins, and he
shoved one after another into the farther part of the
hot oven.
</p>

<p>
Then Mrs. Price turned to get water from the pump
which is set just over the spring in the scullery, and
then she bustled away on one of the thousand odd jobs
that await the farmer's women-folk at every turn.  Or
did she do it on purpose to leave those two together,
working in the cosy, fragrant place?
</p>

<p>
For some minutes they were silent as a couple of
working ants.  Not a sound but the scraping of that
shovel against the oven-floor!
</p>

<p>
Then he began, very gently, "D'you know who I
feel sorry for?"
</p>

<p>
"No," from Elizabeth, setting her last tin loaf on
the shovel.  "Who?"
</p>

<p>
"Er ... People who have to get engaged in town,"
was his unexpected reply.  "Such a beastly rush.  All
mixed up with&mdash;er&mdash;taxis, and catching trains and
crowds of people in restaurants all watching you!
Having to go to the theatre....  And then the lights
going up, or the curtain.  And people all hissing
'Ssh!' when you want to talk to the girl.  Everybody
jostling you.  Not a bit of peace, you know.  No
room!  No&mdash;er&mdash;time to say anything or feel
anything.  Don't you know?"
</p>

<p>
I can picture the Man-hater suppressing her happy
little fluster at this; taking up the fruit tarts that had
to go in in front of the oven, after the loaves.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Fielding's shy but deliberate voice went on:
"I think one's&mdash;er&mdash;courtship ought to come in
pleasant places.  Where there's quiet.  And nice things
about.  And jolly things to do.  Making hay.  Or
... bread.  Don't you think so?"
</p>

<p>
Of course she thought so.  The fields, the farm; any
girl might envy Elizabeth the scenes that set first love
for her, without hurry, without artificiality or fatigue!
But I expect Elizabeth only flushed deeper and deeper
pink, half with emotion, half with the heat of that oven.
Little bright beads of moisture had gathered about her
forehead and neck; annoyed, she brushed them away
with the sleeve of her overall, hoping that he did not see.
</p>

<p>
As if anything she did would escape him now!
</p>

<p>
He moved from the oven and said thoughtfully: "I
wish I could remember that quotation properly."
</p>

<p>
"A quotation?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, something I read about the sweetest sight in
the world being that of a woman baking bread, and
how, even if it were in the&mdash;er&mdash;sweat of her brow,
what man was there '<i>who would not rather kiss those
drops away, than the powder from the cheek of a
Duchess'?</i>"
</p>

<p>
Having arrived at this stage of the story as told me
by Elizabeth herself, I said to her: "And immediately
after this, I suppose, the young man proposed to you?"
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth then told me: "He didn't propose at all."
</p>

<p>
"What?" I cried.
</p>

<p>
"He didn't propose," repeated the Man-hater
obstinately.  "I did."
</p>

<p>
"You?"
</p>

<p>
"I had to," explained my little chum, glowing.  "He
made me."
</p>

<p>
"What can you mean, 'made' you?"
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth explained how "that quotation" had made
her so embarrassed (being quite unused to these
remarks from men) that she hadn't known what to say
and had practically snapped the young man's head off.
</p>

<p>
She told him sharply: "The bottled currants have
got to go into the oven when the bread comes out.
You might help to fetch them and their tin trays out
of the scullery, instead of just standing there talking."
</p>

<p>
At that Colonel Fielding seemed positively to wither
away where he stood.  He looked suddenly miserable
(according to Elizabeth).  He said in the most
unhappy voice: "Have I&mdash;er&mdash;put my foot into it
again?  I suppose I must have, somehow.  You're
angry with me, Miss Weare.  I'll go."
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth begged him not to go (I don't suppose the
creature had made a movement to the door), and said
she wasn't in the least angry, why should she be?
</p>

<p>
The young Colonel then adopted a truly pathetic
tone (I could hear it!) about his being "very unfortunate
with women, who always had a down on him.  Yes!
They thought he was like a barber's block, and hated
him.  All of 'em!"
</p>

<p>
I could imagine his sidewards tilt of the head as he
told the tale to Elizabeth, the boyishly-sincere.
</p>

<p>
She, blurting out "<i>I</i> don't hate you!" hurried into
the scullery for a couple of those tall glass jars of fruit
for bottling.  He followed her, carrying more fruit
and murmuring that no girl could be got to care for
him; not really care!
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth said he looked more than ever like that
picture "The Falconer" on her chocolate-box lid.  I
can imagine her adoring glance up at him!
</p>

<p>
This was in the kitchen, again in front of the oven.
He had taken hold with both hands of the tray that
she still held.
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't believe it," the young villain told her,
gazing into her flushed face.  "Not unless I heard it
out of a girl's own mouth!  Not unless she cared
enough to say so first!"
</p>

<p>
Here Elizabeth broke off the story with a defiant "So
you see!"
</p>

<p>
"What did you <i>say</i>?" I urged.
</p>

<p>
Neither of them would ever tell me.  However!
Before kind Mrs. Price returned (to see they did not
repeat that old story of Alfred and the Cakes!)
Elizabeth had said whatever it was.
</p>

<p>
In this proposal-scene she, the girl, had been forced
to take the initiative.
</p>

<p>
That went against all my instincts; I couldn't have
done that.  How human beings vary!  For she, strange
little thing, simply loved being made to "make the
running."  This I didn't understand.
</p>

<p>
"<i>He</i> understood.  <i>He's</i> not like that great hulking
brute you prophesied for me, the one who would trample
on me with policemen's seventeens!  <i>You</i> thought I
would be 'tamed' by somebody bullying me.  <i>That's</i>
not what happens to a girl like me; that's all wrong
psychology," babbled my chum exultantly, while I
realized that the last phrase at least must have come from
him.  "It's only the frilly, helpless, overfeminized
weepers that admire these huge, bullying navvies with
ugly faces and muscles like vegetable marrows!  I'd
have been safe from <i>them</i> for ever!  But he's so
wonderful!  <i>He's</i> not a usual young man&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And you're not a usual girl," I told her affectionately.
"My dears!  There is only one thing to be
said: <i>you certainly have found each other!</i>"

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"H√©las, mon ami!<br>

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
As for me, I was delighted.  Let one of us be
happy, I thought; let Elizabeth, since I was
evidently fated to be lonely!
</p>

<p>
Yes!  Any love-story for me, Joan Matthews, seemed
to be something quite past praying for.
</p>

<p>
Twice, now, I had fallen in love.  Twice I had drawn
a blank!
</p>

<p>
The first time I'd set my affections upon a philanderer
(Harry Markham) who had given me every reason
to think they were returned, but who probably hadn't
"meant" anything, even before he deserted to Muriel.
</p>

<p>
The second time I had lost my heart to a man worth
a hundred Harrys.  This man (Dick Holiday) had
never attempted to admire me.  He was just helpful
and jolly and friendly, but he'd never pretended to
think of me in that other way.  Yet I couldn't stop
caring for him with all the best that was in me.  And
now he was Muriel's too; I only waited to hear when
their engagement would be announced.
</p>

<p>
"Really I ought to be phenomenally lucky at cards,
seeing the sort of luck I've had in Love!" I laughed at
myself.
</p>

<p>
For I could still laugh; and here I must put forward
something in my own defence!  <i>I was taking the second
love-fiasco very differently from my first</i>.
</p>

<p>
In London, over Harry's desertion, I had let go all
ropes, and had fretted and wept myself into a nervous
wreck.
</p>

<p>
Here on the Land, I never thought of behaving like
that.  I set my teeth to "stick" unhappy Love, which
is a girl's equivalent for a soldier's "sticking" his most
painful wound.  I found I could still enjoy myself
among the other girls, I could still be sympathetic over
my chum's engagement.  I could throw myself body
and soul into the work on the farm, where the
hay-harvest was now in full swing.
</p>

<p>
That work saved me, my self-respect, my spirits, and
my looks from the ruin that threatens the very being
of the girl who is crossed in love.  How she endures
that is so largely a matter of health after all.  My
health was now magnificent.  Every day I grew
fitter, more vigorous, rosier (though my nickname of
"Celery-face" would persist to the end of my life here!)
and more full of zest for anything that happened along.
For on the Land one soon learns not only to take the
rough with the smooth, but also to take plenty of
interest in both.
</p>

<p>
Now, after a couple of weeks of strenuous toil, there
came a promise of "smooth"; a little treat.
</p>

<p>
A note arrived for me at the Land Girls' Camp which
said:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
"DEAR CELERY-FACE&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>These nice people that I work for suggest that I
should ask a couple of 'my young friends' over to tea
next Sunday.  Will you and Mop be the young friends?
They know Captain Holiday and are asking him, so
I expect he will bring Mop's 'lovely Spaniard' with
him.  Do come.</i>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"<i>Yours</i>, SYBIL.
</p>

<p>
"P. S.&mdash;<i>These people think the uniform so 'picturesque,'
so come in it, even if Mop does want to wear
garden-party clothes for the fianc√©!</i>"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
By the way, I have not yet dwelt on the enormous
excitement that blazed all over our Camp at the news
that "little Mop, the Man-hater!" had actually got
engaged to be married to "Colonel Fielding who was that
Spanish lady at the Concert!"
</p>

<p>
That sensation could have been beaten by nothing,
unless perhaps news had come that same day of the
sudden and complete surrender of the whole German
Army.
</p>

<p>
Anybody who has lived the communal life among girls
(as most girls have in these days of Women's Service!)
can imagine the whirlwind of exclamations, congratulations,
questions, laughter that almost carried the
newly-engaged messmate off her sturdily-booted little
feet.  Only, no imagination can do justice to the golden
camaraderie with which that Timber-gang and those
other Land-workers at our Camp took Elizabeth to
their hearts.  (I hoped that her <i>fianc√©</i> would realize
it; for after that he could never again say that girls
were usually "little" and "spiteful"!)  They had
always liked my plucky, downright little chum.  Now,
they couldn't do enough for her!
</p>

<p>
Peggy, who had started an elaborately crocheted
camisole-top for her own bottom-drawer, dedicated it
to Elizabeth.  Peggy's Sergeant Syd brought an
offering of a table-centre, designed and worked by
himself in the gaudiest silks with the crest of Colonel
Fielding's regiment, as well as with a Land Army hat, a rake
and a rifle crossed, the motto "England must be fed!"
and other emblems.  This was her very first wedding-present,
an object that, whatever shape it takes, never
fails to stir the heart of any engaged girl!  But
Elizabeth, who had flashes of defensiveness and of seeming
to make (outwardly) little of Love and Marriage,
declared that the wedding was not going to be for
ages.
</p>

<p>
"The Colonel, he'll watch that," had been Vic's
laconic comment.
</p>

<p>
"The earliest that it can be," Elizabeth had then
announced, "is when my year is up."
</p>

<p>
"Good idea," Miss Easton, the forewoman, had
pronounced drily.  "But you might remember that the
Secretary is able to let you have a brand-new overall
in advance before the six months yours has got to go,
if you want it."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want a new overall," from my chum, glancing
down at her already well-worn garment.  "What for,
Miss Easton?"
</p>

<p>
"Lots of the girls like to get married in uniform, my
dear."
</p>

<p>
"I shan't be getting married for eighteen months at
least," had been Elizabeth's ultimatum.
</p>

<p>
"That's putting a lot of extra work on me and
Vic!" the young forewoman had sighed whimsically.
</p>

<p>
For every evening now Miss Easton had a Thermos
filled and a packet of bread-and-butter or rock-cakes
ready for "Mop" to take after work, so that she
could have her tea out with her <i>fianc√©</i> in the field, where
they met at a stile.  (Those were the halcyon hours
for them both!)
</p>

<p>
As for Vic, the big, good-natured Cockney had taken
in hand the appearance of Elizabeth.  Vic now
"shined" her Sunday brogues, Vic saw that she always
had a pair of the neatest brown stockings to wear with
them, Vic ironed her smock, Vic "saw to" her armlet
and badges; Vic, every evening, gave ten minutes to
brushing "young Mop's" short, thick crop until it
shone and floated out like raw brown silk round her
face.
</p>

<p>
"Must have you looking a credit to US," the
self-constituted female batman said to her.  "Remember,
all eyes&mdash;such as there are of 'em here&mdash;are upon
you!  The girl that's going to marry the D.S.O.
You jolly well reflect back on the Camp, my girl, and
then some more D.S.O.'s will come round looking to
see if there's any more at home like you (perhaps).
You let me put your belt straight.  Now, got a clean
handkie?  Like a drop o' Lil's scent on it?  No?  He
don't care for scent?  All right.  Now I think you're
ready"&mdash;all this was just before Elizabeth and I
started off for that somewhat eventful tea at the house
of Sybil's employers.
</p>

<p>
"Now, young Celery-face," Vic went on, "how do
you look?  Yes, you'll do nicely.  Of course I may be a
bit more particular about the way I turn you out as
soon as you get engaged.  You'll be the next, I
bet&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't bet much," I advised her, smiling above
the little stab at my heart as I disengaged myself from
Vic's kindly hands&mdash;and clothes-brush.  "You'll only
be disappointed.  I shall not oblige you by getting
engaged from the farm, Vic!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Why ever not, if I may inquire?"
</p>

<p>
"Largely because nobody is likely to ask me!" I
answered as we left the hut.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, go on!" Vic called after me as she stood in the
doorway, laughing and waving the clothes-brush.
"F'rall you know, somebody's going to ask you at this
Do this very afternoon!"
</p>

<p>
Now if Vic had heard the story of that Sunday
afternoon-party that was coming, I expect her verdict would
have been: "There!  What did I tell you?  Many
a true word is spoken in jest!"
</p>

<p>
That afternoon witnessed my first offer of marriage&mdash;No,
I had forgotten.  It was not my first.  My first
had been by letter, that improbable-sounding sort of
letter that I'd received in the Spring from the young
man called Richard Wynn, and that I had tossed away
by mistake into a London County Council waste-paper
bin before I'd even answered it.  That was the first!
</p>

<p>
The second was by word of mouth, and it took place
under the sun of early July, in one of the prettiest
country gardens that ever&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
But I'll begin with the house where we were invited
by these people for whom our colleague Sybil was now
working.
</p>

<p>
We walked for a good two miles down a lane branching
off, under trees, from the road to our farm; we came
at last to a white gate and then up a drive bordered
with tall flowers that flourished as they chose in the
long grass.  The house&mdash;which had one of those
interminable Welsh names beginning with "Dol"&mdash;was
long and white, striped green by creepers, and with a
wide porch garlanded with heavy-headed roses.
</p>

<p>
Just to the right of the porch a long window-box
filled with black pansies stood in front of an open upper
window.  A girl's rosy face and wavy hair peeped out;
it was the daughter of the house who called to us in a
voice which, though pleasant, would have made her
fortune as a pilot on the Mersey, "A-hoy!  How d'you
do? ... Syb&mdash;il!  Here are your friends! ... Come
in, will you?  Don't stop to ring; it doesn't."
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth and I went straight into the cool, shady
hall, and into the midst of one of the most welcoming
and hospitable, the least conventional homes that I have
ever entered.
</p>

<p>
We were greeted by Sybil's employers, the master
and mistress of the house.  He, an old soldier, wearing
the hearthrug-like tweeds and the mossy stockings of
a country squire of that neighbourhood; she a plump
and still pretty woman in spotted black and white muslin,
with wavy hair like her daughter's grown grey, and
with an egg-basket which she never put down, over her
arm.  He and she seldom stopped talking, always talked
at once; generally in the form of questions.
</p>

<p>
Thus&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"My dears, won't you come and sit down?  Did you
walk all the way from Careg?  Aren't you tired?"
</p>

<p>
"Does Miss Sybil know these young ladies have come,
Mother?  Can't we have some tea for them at once?"
</p>

<p>
"One of you is engaged to that friend of our friend,
Captain Holiday's; is it you?  No?  You?  Isn't that
very nice?  Will it be a long engage&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Where's Miss Sybil?"  (Enter from the back our
friend Sybil, smiling, but unable to get a word
in.)  "Now, where's Vera, where's that girl Violet&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Violet (the daughter of the house) came running down
to add her voice to this family anthem.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!  Did you find your way easily?  Daddy,
where are the dogs? ... Dogs!" (loudly).
"Sybil, you're not going to try to introduce everybody,
are you?  Why are we all standing here?  Why
aren't we taking these people into the drawing-room?"
</p>

<p>
We were borne along into the big drawing-room to
the right of the hall.  It was full of flowers and lovely
old furniture and silver-framed photographs and an
immense round tea-table and a cluster of other guests.
</p>

<p>
Here the sun rose again upon Elizabeth's world.
Her eyes had fallen at once upon her <i>fianc√©</i>, Colonel
Fielding.  He was sitting there, near his friend,
Captain Holiday.
</p>

<p>
What a merry tea-fight that was in the hospitable
and happy-go-lucky Welsh country-house!
</p>

<p>
To sit in a dainty drawing-room amidst a cluster of
strangers wearing "real" summer frocks.  To see a
winking bright silver spirit-kettle and a snowy cobweb
cloth.  To drink tea from fragile cups and to spread,
with crystal-handled knives, honey upon wafer
bread-and-butter!
</p>

<p>
These little luxuries we never noticed in our
pre-War days.  But now&mdash;&mdash;  Remember!  It was the first
time for weeks that we Land-girls had tasted such
refinement!
</p>

<p>
"What a treat this all is," I remarked to Captain
Holiday as he handed hot cakes in a lordly dish.
</p>

<p>
He replied: "Ah!  Now perhaps you'll have an
idea how fellows feel when they get out of the mud and
plum-and-apple-with-chloride-of-lime up the Line, and
back to Civilization for a few days' leave."
</p>

<p>
"When I got my Paris leave last year," put in the
demure voice of Colonel Fielding, who had dropped into
a low chair close to his <i>fianc√©e</i>, "do you know what
was the first thing I did?"
</p>

<p>
"D'you want us to guess, my boy?" boomed the
genial master of the house, who was also a Colonel.
</p>

<p>
The younger man smiled at him.  "I'll tell you, sir.
I ordered a great sheaf of La France roses and lilac to
be sent up, with a huge glass jar to put 'em in, to my
room at the Hotel.  And there I lay and looked at 'em,
till <i>d√©jeuner</i>, because I hadn't seen a flower for
months!"
</p>

<p>
The other guests then took up that never-failing
topic of leave, and how some people always get it
and some never; why?  A question unanswerable.  I
thought of Captain Harry Markham, nicknamed in his
regiment "The Special Leave King."  But the thought
of my faithless admirer could not depress me now.
For the moment I was perfectly content, sitting at that
gay tea-table between my motherly hostess and Dick
Holiday.
</p>

<p>
He chaffed me about "a woman's ineradicable love
of luxury, on the Land or off!" and I laughed, glad
that I could sometimes see him thus for half an hour,
without any Muriel to spoil it all.
</p>

<p>
On the other side, my hostess's questioning talk
flowed on.
</p>

<p>
"You like the Farm-work, my dear?" to me.  "Your
people don't mind you taking it up?  The
Prices look after you?  Perfect dears, aren't they?
Has Mrs. Price had the Isle of Wight disease?  Her
bees, I mean?  No?  How's that, I wonder, when
everybody else's bees in the county&mdash;oh, she doesn't
keep bees? ... When are your friend and Colonel
Fielding to be married?"
</p>

<p>
"Not for a <i>long</i> time!" burst from Elizabeth, but
our kind hostess went on, unheeding.
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't we arrange to have the wedding from this
house?  I adore weddings, don't you? ... Vera!" to
a laughing blonde in light blue who was a niece of the
house, "you haven't eaten all the light-cakes?  Aren't
there any more light-cakes for when Captain Holiday's
cousin comes in?  Dick!  You did say your cousin,
Miss Elvey, was coming later?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes!" from my neighbour.  "She's driving up
presently."
</p>

<p>
My heart sank.
</p>

<p>
Muriel Elvey was coming after all?
</p>

<p>
Even as I thought it there was a crunching of light
wheels on the gravel outside.  A dog-cart drove up
holding khaki and the flutter of a dress.
</p>

<p>
A moment later Muriel entered.  Just a bright-headed
bouquet of muslin, rose-sprigged with mauve!
Even as she uttered smiling greetings she made every
other girl there look comparatively plain at once.
</p>

<p>
As for me, I instantly became a hopeless clodhopper
sitting there in rough breeches and smock, with my
thick brogues planted on the soft carpet.  Awkward
and out of place, all enjoyment was over for me as
soon as Dick Holiday's fashionable contrast of a girl
floated into the drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
The man who had driven her up came in a few
moments afterwards.
</p>

<p>
To my surprise, it was Harry again!  "More leave,
Markham?" I heard Colonel Fielding laugh; and then
Harry, "No, I just got down for the week-end."
</p>

<p>
So he had come all that way, just to be near Muriel.
Oh, what it must be to have her power over men!  As
far as I could see, there was only one man in that
party who wasn't at her little feet as she sat coquetting
now with the master of the house.  Elizabeth's <i>fianc√©</i>
had said, "I know too much about her!  I know her
kind!"
</p>

<p>
What did the young Colonel mean?
</p>

<p>
However!  He didn't count; being engaged, and,
as Elizabeth herself said, "not a 'usual' young man."
</p>

<p>
One thing I noticed about one of the more "usual"
young men there.  Harry Markham was not himself
that afternoon.  Something was weighing on him.
</p>

<p>
I knew it!  I knew his face and ways so well.
Hadn't I studied them, as only a girl in love has
patience to study, for a whole year?
</p>

<p>
Nobody else out of that roomful of people would
detect any cloud.  Harry was a young man who could
"make himself at home" anywhere.  He did so now.
I saw everybody&mdash;except perhaps Dick Holiday,
who suddenly turned silent&mdash;summing up Captain
Markham as a charming fellow.
</p>

<p>
He talked pleasantly; to our host of salmon-fishing
and of soldiering in the East; to our hostess of bees
and poultry.  Elizabeth he congratulated prettily,
telling her that he (Harry) had spotted Fielding as "a
man determined to win" the first time he met him.
Even Elizabeth had been slightly mollified by this
towards the man she'd once pronounced "a rotter!"  He
laughed and made himself agreeable.  And only I
realized that while he did so his mind was not in any
of it.
</p>

<p>
Why?
</p>

<p>
I thought I guessed.
</p>

<p>
As they came along in the dog-cart he had been
trying to make love to the only girl he couldn't win
over at once.
</p>

<p>
Muriel had been unkind to him.  What a revenge
for me&mdash;if I wanted a revenge, which I didn't.
</p>

<p>
So far I guessed.  But not what was coming!
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIX
<br><br>
LOVE&mdash;&mdash;AFTER THE INTERVAL
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Let this be said between us here,<br>
  One love grows green as one grows grey,<br>
  Tomorrow has no more to say<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To yesterday."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;SWINBURNE.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
At last the long leisurely tea of Sunday
afternoon in a country-house came to an end.
People strayed out into the grounds, a little
green and golden world of peace it was!
</p>

<p>
I heard Colonel Fielding's velvet voice murmuring
"Carissima&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
This was his pet name for his sweetheart.  She
called him "Falconer."  The pair of them wandered
off together and disappeared with the swift and utter
completeness possible only to lovers&mdash;or to small
boys who are called to have their faces washed.
</p>

<p>
The others drifted towards the water-garden, or
to inspect the vegetables which were Sybil's domain;
Sybil, the garden-girl, was entirely one of the family
here.
</p>

<p>
Muriel (of course) called to Dick Holiday to come
and translate the motto on the sun-dial for her.
</p>

<p>
And then, suddenly, I found a figure in khaki with
soft dark eyes under a scarlet-banded cap, edging
purposefully towards me in a manner that recalled a year
now dead.
</p>

<p>
How often I had longed in vain for this to happen!
What fruitless tears I'd shed!  And now&mdash;&mdash;  Oh,
why do people pine, after long years to see their first
loves again?  It is, nearly always, a mistake to meet
them any more....  It is a wash-out!
</p>

<p>
Shakespere's most characteristic lover puts it all in
a nutshell.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough, no more!<br>
  'Tis not as sweet now as it was before."<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
But Harry Markham, whom I had once thought such
a man of the world, had less <i>savoir vivre</i> than the Count
Orsino.
</p>

<p>
"Joan," he murmured ingratiatingly as he came up,
"I haven't been allowed a single word with you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Presently I found myself having the "word" alone
with him at the bottom of the garden, away from the
others in a sheltered nook screened by a hedge of
sweetpeas.
</p>

<p>
Harry always was an adept at these arrangements.
Strange, to think that he should be making them again
for me after all these months!
</p>

<p>
He began in a voice distinctly sentimental, "It's a
long time, isn't it, since ... last summer?  Look
here, there's a seat.  We'll sit down."
</p>

<p>
"Not for long," said I, matter-of-fact.  "I have to
get back soon, to Camp."
</p>

<p>
"Camp," returned Harry, as he sat down beside
me on the garden-bench.  "Sounds odd to hear all
you girls talking about 'Camp' like a lot of Tommies."
</p>

<p>
"We're rather proud of being like them."
</p>

<p>
"Of course.  But, I say, who are you with all
day?  What do you have to do?"
</p>

<p>
I answered his questions as concisely as I could.  I,
who used to prize every moment with him! felt I wanted
to join the others!
</p>

<p>
He nodded; asked "Don't you mind having to
rough it?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't call it 'roughing it' very badly, thank
you.  I enjoy it."
</p>

<p>
"Sporting of you," declared Harry, "but not a
bit the sort of thing you used to be keen on, Joan.
You've altered."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I agreed quietly.  "I think I have altered
a good deal."
</p>

<p>
He sent one of those well-known glances of his from
under the peak of his cap as he sat.  "I needn't tell
you how the life suits you, as far as looks go.  I've
never seen you with such a colour, and your hair's all
full of those gold gleams I always thought so topping&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
For the first time in my life that caressing voice
left me cold.
</p>

<p>
"That kit is jolly becoming to you."
</p>

<p>
"Yes?" I said politely.  "I thought you admired
pretty frocks."
</p>

<p>
"Those suited you, too.  But in this you're a young
Ceres."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid I've forgotten what those were."
</p>

<p>
"She was the goddess of Harvest or something,"
explained Harry, discomfited.  "Somebody outdoor
and glowing and rosy, with a lovely figure, if I may
say so&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Why not?"  I smiled at him in a friendly way.
</p>

<p>
He amused me, now.  I was rather tickled to see
him not quite knowing how to talk to me after this
silence of months in which he'd left me without a
good-bye.
</p>

<p>
I saw him like a precocious schoolboy who has been
rude to somebody and who wants to apologize without
losing his dignity.
</p>

<p>
And, as I say, I used to see him as the most wonderful,
the cleverest mixture of a man of the world and a
demigod!
</p>

<p>
To think how we can change....  But he imagined
I was still the adoring conquest of those old days in
town.
</p>

<p>
He thought I was putting up a gallant little bit
of feminine bluff.  He imagined that my heart was still
beating as wildly as ever it did at the sound of his
voice, the glance of his eyes that courted and caressed.
</p>

<p>
Gone was their magic for me!  Harry Markham
didn't realize that.
</p>

<p>
That want of perception helped him towards one
of the biggest mistakes he was ever to make!
</p>

<p>
I, who thought I could read every sign of his
handsome, rather self-conscious young face, I'd never
foreseen it.
</p>

<p>
No, not even when he began by lowering his voice
to its most persuasive pitch.
</p>

<p>
"Joan!  You aren't being very nice to me.  You're
fed with me about something."
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit," I assured him.
</p>

<p>
Reproachful glance from Captain Markham.  "My
dear little girl&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
How long was it since I'd thrilled to hear myself
called this?  Today I found it the wrong expression;
I was nearly as tall as he was, after all, I thought.
Also I felt rather bored with the turn that the
conversation was taking.
</p>

<p>
No more flirtation for me, thanks.
</p>

<p>
"My dear little girl, d'you suppose I don't know
the difference between this and the jolly chummy
times we used to have?" he appealed to me.  "You've
forgotten the day we went to Hampton Court."
</p>

<p>
"I have not," said I, looking away.  "I remember
it perfectly.  We came back too late to go to the
theatre, and we were so disappointed."
</p>

<p>
"I don't remember any disappointment," he said
softly.  "I only remember ... a perfect day."
</p>

<p>
Of course I too remembered that the day at Hampton
Court had been the first time Harry had kissed
me.  My face flamed with annoyance to think I had
permitted this.  I rose from the garden-bench.  What
busy centuries I'd lived through since that morning at
breakfast with Elizabeth in our London flat, when the
universe had been darkened for me by the news of
Harry's going!  Now it had come to my turn to want
to go.  Uncanny in the light of what had been, but
true!  The familiar figure in khaki and scarlet seemed
to me that of a quiet, strange young man to whom I
didn't want to talk at all.
</p>

<p>
I took a step down the grassy path.  He followed
me, speaking in the ingratiating manner that was
second nature to him.  I could not help hearing a note of
insincerity in his voice now; yes, and a note of odd
impatience.  It was as if he'd set himself to play some
part and were irritated with me because I did not play
up to him.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Joan, wait!  I brought you out here on purpose
to say something to you.  Not about Hampton
Court&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No; that's all over," I assured him, meaning more
than just one picnic.
</p>

<p>
"But I want to talk about you.  How long d'you
mean to go on with this farm-business?"
</p>

<p>
"I signed on for a year.  Why?"
</p>

<p>
"What d'you suppose you'll do after that year?"
</p>

<p>
I pulled a mauve-and-purple sweetpea out of the
hedge as we passed.  "Who knows?  Perhaps stay on
the Land for good."
</p>

<p>
"A girl like you?"
</p>

<p>
"Or I might transfer into the Women's Forestry
Corps later on.  They'll want people for replanting
the timber where all the lovely woods have been cut
down.  The Forester here says girls are particularly
good for nursery-work; they're quick and light-footed,
and don't trample down the young plants."
</p>

<p>
Harry seemed to care little about that question,
though he'd surprised me by his sudden interest in
my own career.  This after months of forgetting my
existence!
</p>

<p>
"It's all very well for you to do this in War-time,"
he told me.  "The War, though, will be over before
we're old, I hope.  You can't go on tramping round
filthy turnip-fields and feeding pigs and pigging it
yourself in a wooden shanty with Heaven knows who!"
</p>

<p>
"I like it."
</p>

<p>
"No," he insisted, rallying.  "Now your little
friend, Miss Weare, has done the sensible thing.  So
will you.  Of course you'll get married too, Joan."
</p>

<p>
"I?  No," I said with unsmiling finality.  "I shall
not get married."
</p>

<p>
At this my old love put back his head and laughed.
</p>

<p>
Then it came.
</p>

<p>
Standing there close to me on the path bordered on
one side by the sweetpeas, on the other by the high
garden wall with its fans of plum and apricot, he
moved as if to pull himself together for a jump.  He
gave one very odd glance about him.  That glance
seemed made up of so many things: resolution, amusement,
pettishness, teasing, ruefulness, a certain kindliness,
and triumph.
</p>

<p>
Then his eyes came back smiling to mine as he
exclaimed, "Ah, darling, rot!  I'll tell you something.
You are going to get married.  I am going to marry
you myself."
</p>

<p>
I suppose no man in this world had ever made that
announcement to a girl feeling more utterly sure of
his success than was Captain Harry Markham at that
moment.  I think no girl in this world can ever have
had more difficulty than I had then in conveying to a
suitor that his proposal was not to be accepted after
all.
</p>

<p>
How he clung to the conviction that I could not
mean what I said, that I was teasing him, paying him
out!
</p>

<p>
"Paying you out?  Why should I?  For what?"
</p>

<p>
"Because&mdash;well, perhaps because I went away
without saying anything that time in the Spring," was
Harry's idea.  "But, darling, I'll make up for that
now, see if I don't&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I put up the hand that held the sweetpea.  His arms
that he was putting out to me fell to his sides again.
</p>

<p>
"Don't, please don't," I begged him.  "It's no use.
I do mean it.  Honour bright, I am not just saying
this to make you ask me again and again.  I am not
going to marry you.  I do not care for you."
</p>

<p>
His dark eyes stared blankly, as they well might.
Last time they had looked deep into mine they had
found adoration.  And that was only a few months
ago; quite a short time, as time is counted!
</p>

<p>
He muttered, crestfallen, "I thought you cared.  I
could have sworn it! ... You were pulling my leg,
then, all last summer!"
</p>

<p>
This from him was almost funny!  But I said quite
gently, "I wasn't."
</p>

<p>
"I believed you liked me a little then," said Harry
Markham softly.  "Will you tell me that?"
</p>

<p>
Now, is it kinder to tell the man whom one no
longer loves that one did really love him once, or better
to let him think that he was mistaken from the first?
Uncertain, I sniffed at that sweetpea and said nothing.
</p>

<p>
He lifted his head and asked quietly: "Some one
else, then?"
</p>

<p>
I turned to pull another sweetpea, shaking my head
as vigorously as Elizabeth could have done.  After all,
there was nobody else ... that wanted me!
</p>

<p>
Harry's voice, encouraged, said over my shoulder:
"Ah, then!  I could get you to like me again if you
would only give me the chance, dear!  Be kind to me.
Look at me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Unreasonably, perhaps, I felt a quick irritation over
that caressing tone that held the note of insincerity
as a soft flower holds a spoiling insect.
</p>

<p>
I turned to look straight at him as he asked me.  I
met his dark eyes.  I said bluntly: "Oh!  Why do
you pretend like this?  I know as well as you do that
you don't care for me yourself a bit!"
</p>

<p>
He gave a quick involuntary movement of surprise.
The charming humbug of the Harry-type seldom gives
anybody credit for seeing, never for seeing through
him.  Immediately he pulled himself together to look
cruelly injured.
</p>

<p>
"Not care for you?" he echoed, indignantly.
"Look here, I've always thought you one of the
sweetest and straightest&mdash;I mean, the sweetest girl I ever
met.  The prettiest, too.  If you knew how lovely you
looked now at this minute with the sun on you!
Lovely and warm-hearted and true.  If you cared for
any man, by Jove, he could bank on you!  And he'd be
the luckiest fellow in&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps," I cut him short rather ungraciously.
"But I am afraid none of this that you say
... Forgive me, but none of it rings true to me."
</p>

<p>
"Not true?  You're trying to make me out a
liar?" retorted Harry heatedly.  "Not true?  A
man doesn't ask a girl to be his for keeps, my dear,
unless he's pretty serious about it.  If it weren't true,
why on earth should I ask you to marry me now,
Joan?"
</p>

<p>
"For a reason that I have guessed," I said steadily.
I moved on to the end of the hedge, turned up the path
towards the garden gate.
</p>

<p>
Harry followed.  I felt that he was fuming and
bewildered.  He muttered: "What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
Without looking at him I replied: "I think you're
asking me to accept you because another girl has
refused you too often.  You want to show another girl
that you don't care; that other people have jumped at
you!  I know that some men have married for no
better reason.  You proposed to me out of pique.  Now,
isn't that the truth?"
</p>

<p>
With the last word I stopped and faced him again.
I saw his face change under my eyes.
</p>

<p>
I insisted: "You don't want to marry anybody but
the girl I introduced you to myself&mdash;Muriel Elvey!"
</p>

<p>
Slowly the scarlet flush deepened on the young man's
face; his eyes wavered, left mine.  Utterly abashed he
looked, shamefaced, miserably embarrassed; and how
much younger in his awkwardness!  He was a schoolboy
again, caught out in some wrong-doing that put
him not only in the wrong, but made him ridiculous&mdash;a
thing no man can stand.
</p>

<p>
And no woman who is a woman can stand the sight
of any man suffering thus!  He was at my mercy;
and my heart melted to him.  Not with the old feeling.
That, once dead, no power on earth can revive.  Only
a new feeling filled me; real kindliness towards him.
Now that we could never be lovers I felt we might be
friends.
</p>

<p>
Impulsively I cried, in a softened voice, "I couldn't
help guessing.  You needn't mind me, Harry!"
</p>

<p>
It was the first time that day that I'd called him
by his name.
</p>

<p>
The trouble in his face seemed lightened by a gleam.
His eyes softened as they met mine again.  I suppose
he saw the offered friendliness in them.
</p>

<p>
Deeply touched, he repeated boyishly, "You are
decent, Joan!"
</p>

<p>
I laughed, repeating, "You needn't mind my having
guessed; I shan't say anything!" I added, very
gently, "Won't she have anything to do with you?"
</p>

<p>
Gloomily he shook his head; the handsome head that
so many girls found irresistible.  "Won't," he said,
curtly.  "She's turned me down half-a-dozen times,
but I've always thought that I might ... might get
round her.  Until this last time when I've seen her
with this fellow Holiday, down here&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I had a sharp stab of remembrance.  "Ah, yes.
Her cousin," I said as casually as I could.
</p>

<p>
Harry, more humbly than I had ever heard him
speak, said: "He's got that fine old place and
everything.  My people have only the money they made.  I
understand her preferring what Holiday could give
her."
</p>

<p>
He concluded, huskily: "He's the fellow she will
marry, I expect."
</p>

<p>
We were fellow-sufferers in the thought, Harry and I!
</p>

<p>
With quick sympathy I laid my hand lightly on his
red-tabbed shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Poor old boy!  I'm so sorry."
</p>

<p>
"You're a little brick," muttered Harry.  Dropping
his chin, he put a small grateful kiss upon my
fingers as they lay on his jacket.
</p>

<p>
It was this scene that met the eyes of Dick Holiday
as he turned the corner of the path, coming to see
what had become of us.

CHAPTER XXX
<br><br>
COLONEL FIELDING DISCUSSES "THE MYSTERY-GIRL"
</h3>

<p class="intro">
"I would rather scrub floors for a man than dust a table for a
woman."&mdash;EXTRACT FROM PRIVATE CONVERSATION.
</p>

<p class="poem2">
  "But for loving, why, you would not, Sweet,<br>
  If we prayed you, paid you, brayed you<br>
  In a mortar, for you could not, Sweet!"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;BROWNING.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
This was something I wouldn't have allowed to
happen, could I have prevented it!
</p>

<p>
For Dick Holiday, of all people, to come
upon me when I was having my hand kissed by Harry
Markham, of all other people in the world!
</p>

<p>
Of course you see what Captain Holiday thought
he had interrupted?
</p>

<p>
A love-scene!
</p>

<p>
He'd heard from me about the man who sailed for
Salonika just before I left London, and that I'd joined
up for the Land Army on that account.  He'd tumbled
to it that Harry, returned from Salonika, was "the"
man.  Now he saw, with his own eyes, this young
staff-officer pressing his lips to the hand which I had put
affectionately upon his red-tabbed shoulder.
</p>

<p>
Naturally Captain Holiday thought this meant the
Happy Ending to whatever misunderstanding I and the
other young man had had.  In his mind I suppose he
was certain that he would soon have to congratulate us!
</p>

<p>
Of course he never betrayed by one twitch of his
face what he thought of what I know he must have
seen.
</p>

<p>
He merely said quietly: "Ah, here you are.  The
others are going, Miss Matthews."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, are they?  Yes, it must be getting late.
Thank you so much for coming to tell me," I said
hurriedly.  The two young men followed me out of
the garden as I made my hasty way up to the house,
fuming!
</p>

<p>
What could be more annoying, I ask you, than to
be so "caught out"?  Especially when one couldn't
possibly explain the meaning of the little incident?
</p>

<p>
I could not turn round and say to the young man
behind me on the path "Captain Holiday, I hope you
won't misunderstand what you saw just now.  Captain
Markham was kissing my hand, and perhaps it did look
as if it were an illustration to a magazine love-story!
But it wasn't that sort of kiss!  It wasn't that sort of
thing at all!  He and I have never been less in love with
one another.  Both of us happen to be hopelessly in
love with somebody else!  For the first time in our lives
we were feeling genuinely fond of each other in a
friendly way because we were sorry for one another's
love tragedies.  Nothing could have been more entirely
platonic!"
</p>

<p>
No.  I couldn't tell him this, true as it was.  For
one thing, even the best and simplest and truest
explanations have a way of sounding "thin."  Hence
the golden rule "NEVER EXPLAIN."  Following it, I
reached the house with my two cavaliers and found that
the whole party were gathered outside the porch
waiting for us.
</p>

<p>
Our host was at the head of the horse in the dog-cart,
where Muriel had already perched herself, and
everybody was chattering over the great bunches of
roses and sweetpeas given them by our hostess ... it
was then that I realized that Sybil's new employers
must be almost as hard up as we were ourselves.  For
how seldom it is that the gardens of the rich spare a
single petal for the flowerless guest!  But here the
daughter of the house had stripped even her own
window-boxes of black pansies to make into a posy for me.
Muriel, sitting up in the cart, called, smiling, "Are you
coming, Harry?  I really must get back to poor dear
Mother now.  But if you want to walk," with a
coquettish glance, "my cousin will drive me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I saw Dick Holiday's quick step forward on the
gravel.  He was only too anxious, I could see, to
respond to this invitation.  But already Harry was
before him, poor Harry! his face lighting up because his
lady who refused him always could still be got to throw
him a smile....  It was an irony of the Fate that had
made so many girls ready to hang on the smiles of a
man like Harry Markham.  He sprang up, took the
reins.
</p>

<p>
She was driven away, her flower-face smiling over
her other flowers, her little hand waving gaily;
Disturber of the Peace that she was!
</p>

<p>
The walking-party&mdash;amidst a buzz of kindly
farewells and "<i>come agains</i>" and a last call from the
mistress of the house of "<i>you won't forget that I should
love a Land-girl's wedding from here?</i>"&mdash;set off down
the road back to our Camp.
</p>

<p>
I had been dreading the thought of a walk <i>√† deux</i>
with Captain Holiday; since Elizabeth would naturally
stroll homewards at a snail's pace with her adored
"Falconer" off a chocolate-box lid.
</p>

<p>
To my astonishment I found that I was to have this
privilege!  I found that somehow it was arranged that
Captain Holiday was walking with Elizabeth, briskly,
in front.
</p>

<p>
He didn't want to speak to me, then?  I was left to
follow with my chum's <i>fianc√©</i>.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Fielding was remarkably nice and friendly
to me for the whole of that walk.  I seemed to have
reached a stage when men became unsentimental and
excellent friends with me.  Was it, I wondered gloomily,
because none of them ever fell in love with me any
more?  And as I chatted to Colonel Fielding of the
"delightfulness" of the afternoon we'd just spent, I
thought with a rueful little sigh of one young man who
had been (presumably) a little sentimental about me.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Richard Wynn, who'd written to ask me to
marry him! because he had liked the child I had been,
seven years ago.  What must he have thought of me
for never even answering his letter...!
</p>

<p>
I didn't often remember that shadowy suitor.  I forgot
him again as I said to Colonel Fielding, walking
beside me, "How sweetly pretty Miss Elvey was looking!"
</p>

<p>
He looked mischievous and said: "Are you still
afraid she'll make me faithless to Elizabeth?"
</p>

<p>
"My good young man, I don't think she'll try."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!  She'd never want to," he agreed serenely.
"It never was me the young lady was anxious to marry.
I know who it is all right."
</p>

<p>
I looked at him eagerly.  At last I was going to get
a little light on the subject!  At last I was going to
hear another opinion about whether Muriel meant in
the long run to say "Yes" or "No" to Captain Holiday.
</p>

<p>
I nodded towards his distant back as it turned a
corner of the lane in front of us.  I suggested to his
friend "You mean&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"Er&mdash;&mdash;of course."
</p>

<p>
My heart felt absurdly heavy at the announcement.
Had I still hoped that it could be otherwise?  Silly
of me!
</p>

<p>
I asked, succeeding in not sounding wistful: "Do
you think, then, that she is in love with him after all,
Colonel Fielding?"
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth's young Colonel stopped on the road where
we walked.  He turned to me as if he hadn't caught
what I'd said.  He frowned a little, and yet he was
smiling under that absurdly soft golden feather of a
moustache.  He repeated: "In love?  Miss Elvey?
Of course not.  Miss Elvey isn't the kind of girl
who would ever be in love with anybody whomsoever."
</p>

<p>
I stopped too.  We faced each other on that road
at a dead standstill, as people do when their talk
becomes more interesting to each other than their walk.
I was more than eager to know exactly what this young
man thought of the girl who had stolen my admirer,
and who was probably going to marry the other man
whom I myself admired.  The girl whom all men loved
and of whom all women were jealous.  What was
Colonel Fielding's view of her?
</p>

<p>
"You told me, the day you got engaged, that when
you had time you would tell me all about Muriel's
'kind,'" I reminded him.  "Tell me now."
</p>

<p>
"Oh ... er ... I don't know that there's so
much to tell," he said, looking at me.  "She's just one
of the mystery-girls who seem to have everything a girl
should have; looks, go, charm, laughter.  But ... er
... Well!  She hasn't got love.  That power's just
been left out of her composition, Miss Matthews.
She's cold; she's null.  She's&mdash;she's just the opposite
to your little friend," his voice grew tender, "and
mine."
</p>

<p>
"Elizabeth?  But&mdash;except for you&mdash;Elizabeth
doesn't like men.  Muriel doesn't like anything better!"
</p>

<p>
He shook his head, the only man's head I'd met that
seemed full of "feminine" intuitions.
</p>

<p>
"Muriel doesn't like men," he told me.  "She likes
what men can give her.  Attention.  A good time.
Admiration <i>ad lib</i>.  The cachet of being seen about,
queening it over them.  The sense of power; the
atmosphere of ... er ... incense.  That's what
Muriel asks of men.  Nothing else."
</p>

<p>
Puzzled, I said: "I don't understand."
</p>

<p>
"You would not."
</p>

<p>
"I've always thought Muriel a finished flirt, yet you
say she's cold&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Flirts are," declared Elizabeth's lover.  "Er ... I've
heard that the true drunkard dislikes the actual
taste of spirits.  Well!  The true flirt hates the
actual idea of ... er ... Love."
</p>

<p>
He blushed as if with unconquerable shyness, but
went on: "Do you know how the Muriel-type looks
upon a kiss?  As something to be got out of ... er
... or got over."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder," said I.
</p>

<p>
"I know," said he.  "Plenty of them, the Mystery-girls."
</p>

<p>
"Why 'Mystery,' Colonel Fielding?"
</p>

<p>
"Because it is a mystery why they're made like that.
Avid for what they call 'a good time'&mdash;they who can't
<i>taste</i> the real good times!"
</p>

<p>
"You mean the times like&mdash;like that tea we had in
the hayfield; that lunch of your mother's with her old
love."
</p>

<p>
&mdash;"And so forth.  Yes ... Ah, how they surround
themselves with every outward sign of 'a good time,'
how they swallow them up into that <i>gap</i> that can never
be filled in their hearts.  I remember one Mystery-girl&mdash;but
I'm talking too much."
</p>

<p>
"No, no!  Tell me about her."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said my new friend, "she was one of them,
but not like Muriel; a nicer-natured girl altogether,
married, and a topping little mother.  She said to me
once with all her soul in her pretty eyes, 'D'you know,
the two wishes of my heart, Colonel Fielding?  One is
a pearl string down to <i>here</i>.  The other is about ten
silver-fox skins made into a stole.'  I looked at her
(she was a picture).  I said, 'What rum things to
choose for hearts-wishes!'  She said, 'Beautiful
things?'  I said, 'Well, easy to get, anyhow.'  She
said, 'Very expensive!'  I said, 'Not they!  <i>They</i>
only cost ... money.'  We both meant what we said.
She was sweeter than Miss Muriel, too.  Some of them
aren't even as sweet.  But all of them remind me of
those&mdash;er&mdash;gaily-coloured flowers&mdash;without scent.
If I like them, I'm sorry for them.  If I don't like them,
I'm sorry for the Race.  Give me the palest musk-rose..."
</p>

<p>
From his face he was thinking again of his
Carissima....  She meant all sweetness to him.
</p>

<p>
I said: "But men swarm round those others!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; didn't I tell you the other day how weak the
average man is on Love?  He's all for the lovely
... er ... shell of the Mystery-girl.  He adores to be
tantalized and baffled by it ... because he doesn't
know what that means, until he's ... er ... married
and tied to it for life."
</p>

<p>
"And then?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Then he thinks Love must have been overrated
by ... er ... these fiction-writers.  Or he imagines
that he's quite happy, because no one seems to think
he isn't.  Or the Muriel 'pretends' to love him and
he doesn't know the difference, because he '<i>never, even
in dreams, has seen the things that are more
excellent.</i>'  Er ... I do talk too much, Miss Matthews; I bore
you."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed you do not," I said.  "All the week I have
heard nothing discussed but the feeding of the two
baby-calves, and the butter-market.  Even the most
enthusiastic farm-worker likes to go back to the
problems of other lives sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"Still, you look as if I'd ... er ... depressed you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," I protested.  But he had depressed me.
If his theories about Muriel were true, she would never
make Captain Holiday happy!  Wasn't this enough to
sadden me?
</p>

<p>
In his quick, unmasculine way Colonel Fielding
seemed to read my thoughts.
</p>

<p>
He said: "She&mdash;Miss Muriel&mdash;has an eye to the
main chance.  She simply must have the things that
people who've got ... er ... love can afford to do
without.  She covets that lovely old country-house
that's been turned into a hospital.  It'll be turned back
some day.  I really think she'd like to see herself
mistress of it.  Up to now I expect she's hit everything
she's aimed for.  But..."
</p>

<p>
He paused and smiled, a curious, encouraging smile,
at me.
</p>

<p>
He went on: "I don't think&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He paused again before he uttered the very last
words that I expected to hear coming out of his mouth.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think she's going to get our friend ... er
... Richard Wynn."
</p>

<p>
"What?" I said, sharply.  "Colonel Fielding,
what made you say that?"
</p>

<p>
He opened his eyes at me.  "Say what?"
</p>

<p>
"You said 'Richard Wynn.'  What has he got to
do with it?" I asked, stupefied.  "Do you know him?
Because I do, and I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Know him?"  The young man looked at me as
if I'd gone mad.  "Know Wynn?  Holiday?"
</p>

<p>
I gasped.  "You said 'Richard Wynn,'" I
repeated.  "Did you mean to say Captain Holiday?"
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth's <i>fianc√©</i> was still gazing upon me in
bewilderment.  Then he uttered these further strange
words; words that took me more aback than any I'd
heard since I was a child reading <i>The Arabian Nights</i>
by the firelight that criss-crossed my schoolroom
ceiling with the giant shadow of the wire fireguard.
</p>

<p>
He asked: "Miss Matthews, do you mean to say
that you didn't know Dick Holiday and Richard
Wynn were ... er ... the same person?"

CHAPTER XXXI
<br><br>
A FEW FACTS ABOUT RICHARD WYNN
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Look in my face, my name is Might-Have-Been.<br>
  I am also called No-More, Too-Late, Farewell."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;ROSSETTI.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Sensation!
</p>

<p>
In fact, of all the many thunderbolts that
had fallen upon me since I had been working on
the Land, this (as Vic would say) had cleft it.
</p>

<p>
Blank bewilderment was my first feeling.
</p>

<p>
My next feeling was, curiously enough, that I wasn't
surprised after all.
</p>

<p>
I thought "I knew it all the time!  All the time
at the bottom of my mind I felt that there was
something of the kind..."  And swiftly my thoughts
flew back to that day on the hillside when I had been
feeding Mrs. Price's chickens.
</p>

<p>
That was the first time that I had seen Captain
Holiday out of khaki.
</p>

<p>
As I'd caught sight of his light figure in those
ancient tweeds and that disreputable scarecrow's hat
I had at once sensed something familiar.  Through the
mists of forgetfulness a gleam of recognition had
struggled, and I had actually asked: "Isn't your name
Richard Wynn?"
</p>

<p>
He'd denied it&mdash;&mdash;  No.  He had put me off with
"My name is Holiday, you know"; leaving me
wondering why I had asked such an idiotic question.
</p>

<p>
And now, weeks afterwards, here was this friend of
his letting it out casually that the young man's name
was both Holiday and Richard Wynn!
</p>

<p>
What was the meaning of this?  Why did he&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
A hundred questions crowded into my mind.  Other
questions chased each other over the face of Colonel
Fielding as he looked at me.  We were standing as if
turned into a couple of milestones on that country road,
the bright evening sunlight dazzling our eyes.  There
wasn't time for more than a very few of these questions.
I couldn't monopolize Elizabeth's <i>fianc√©</i> for the rest of
the evening!  Yet I had to get in my questions first.
</p>

<p>
Quickly pulling myself together and collecting what
senses seemed to be left to me, I began:
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Fielding, what you've just told me is a
great surprise."
</p>

<p>
"Er&mdash;so it seems," returned Colonel Fielding, still
regarding me in a puzzled manner.  "I say, I am
sorry if I have ...  er ... dropped any sort of
brick.  It just slips out sometimes.  I mean, calling
old Dick 'Wynn' instead of 'Holiday,' even now.
One ought to be quite accustomed to his being 'Holiday'
by this time.  It's ... er ... five years since
he took the name, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't ask me," I returned, bewildered.  "I didn't
know he'd 'taken' any name at all."
</p>

<p>
Colonel Fielding glanced at me again as if he
wondered whether I had got a touch of sun, and said:
</p>

<p>
"But I thought you were ... er ... quite an old
friend of his?  And when you said just now that you
knew him as Richard Wynn&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"This is going to be very difficult to explain," I
exclaimed, helplessly.  "But we can't stand here till
ten o'clock.  We'll talk going along."
</p>

<p>
We went on walking slowly along the road; Elizabeth
having disappeared with that other young man
and his two names.
</p>

<p>
I went on: "Why did he 'take' the name of Holiday?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, because his uncle wished it," was Colonel
Fielding's reply, still in that voice of not being able
to make out why I didn't know all this already.
"You did know&mdash;didn't you?&mdash;that his ... er
... uncle was that old Mr. Holiday who owned all the
property about here; the white house, the lodge, the
Prices' farm, and all the lot?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'd heard that."
</p>

<p>
"Well, about five years ago this old man, who was
a hardened old ... er ... bachelor, thought he'd
like to leave his property to his favourite nephew, who
happened to be our friend.  Dick was then in Canada.
Did you know he'd gone in for ranching in Canada?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I knew 'Mr. Wynn' had," said I.
</p>

<p>
"Well!  The condition was that he wasn't to be
'Mr. Wynn' any more.  He was to assume the name
that went with the property.  It's ... er ... often
done; by deed-poll, as they call it," explained Colonel
Fielding, as if to a child.  "You pay&mdash;I forget how
much, and then you have it in the <i>Gazette</i> and the
<i>Morning Post</i> and things that your name isn't Smith
any more, but Jones or Robinson or ... anything
you choose.  You understand that?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes!  I've heard about such a thing before,
thanks!"  I laughed a little impatiently.  "It isn't
that that I don't understand.  It's about Mr. Richard
Wynn&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Richard Holiday now," Colonel Fielding corrected
me.  "Well!  He stayed in Canada until this ... er
... war broke out.  And then ... Am I just to
run over what happened to him, Miss Matthews?"
</p>

<p>
I reddened a little at having to seem eager to hear
all I could about this young man, who was nothing to
me....  Yet how could I help being eager?  I loved
him.  And I knew so little about him; only the little
that I had seen.  I must hear, from his friend, all that
he would tell me of Dick....  Whether Wynn or
Holiday, his first name would remain the dearest on
earth to me!
</p>

<p>
"Please," I said.
</p>

<p>
So Colonel Fielding's lady-like voice took up the
tale.  "Dick Holiday came over with that first lot
of Canadians, I think they were.  'Little Black
Devils'&mdash;you know the badge?  So do the ... er
... Boches!  It was Salisbury Plain for him that
winter ... er ... mud and circuses!  Then France
at last; and Ypres.  There he was wounded and
gassed&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>And</i> gassed!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and ... er ... why he didn't get his commission
on the field I can't tell you.  He earned it all
right, as well as his Military Medal."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure he did!"
</p>

<p>
"Then I met him in hospital; hadn't see him since
we were at Haileybury together," went on Colonel
Fielding.  "Then we both got out again together.
Then he was wounded again ... er ... badly, in
the knee.  Also shell-shock.  That was last winter.
He did get his commission then.  They brought him
home and put him on ... er ... what they called
'light' duty at home for a bit.  It meant he had to
do the office-work of three ... er ... men at
Millshott Barracks&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" I cried involuntarily.  A detail that had
escaped me for months sprung vividly up in my
consciousness at last.  "<i>Millshott!</i>"  That had been the
name of the barracks stamping the notepaper of that
letter&mdash;that fated letter signed "RICHARD WYNN."
... Why, why in the name of everything that I most
coveted now had I not answered that letter at once?  I
might have had him.  I might have had him....
</p>

<p>
Little guessing my thoughts, Colonel Fielding went
on with his biographical sketch.
</p>

<p>
"At Millshott Dick had a breakdown.  Er ... not
to be wondered at, if you knew half he'd been through
ever since the ... er ... Somme.  It was when he
was in hospital that that uncle of his died suddenly.
That meant he had come in for all this place here.  So
when Dick was put on sick leave, it was ... er
... down here that he came."  Colonel Fielding gave a
sort of little comprehensive gesture about the slanting
Welsh landscape, with the blonde squares that meant
hay-stubble tilted halfway up the sides of the hills.
"And ... er ... here he is.  He's ever so much
better, of course; pottering about the ... er ... farm,
and all that, suits him down to the ground.  He
looks practically ... er ... himself again....
Er&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Here the young Colonel broke off and glanced at
me, almost as if he were asking the question, "Is there
anything else that you want to know?"
</p>

<p>
I answered that glance by saying, quietly, "Thank
you so much for telling me all this.  There is only one
more thing&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes?"
</p>

<p>
"All that I said was in confidence," I told him,
rather confused.  "My being surprised about ... those
names.  My asking you any questions.  I can't
explain, Colonel Fielding.  Only, it will remain between
ourselves."
</p>

<p>
"But of course!" agreed Dick Holiday's friend,
very quickly and quietly.
</p>

<p>
I am sure I don't know what he thought.  I don't
know what he said later to Elizabeth, who, surprised
at her lover's long desertion, was waiting just outside
the entrance to our Camp.  I don't know if Elizabeth
wondered over the interminable conversation which I
seemed to have been having with her Beloved all the
way back from the tea-party.
</p>

<p>
I did not tell that good little chum one word of
what it had all been about.  I&mdash;who had unbosomed
myself to her in the old days on the subject of my
love-affair until she was sick of the very name of
Harry!&mdash;did not feel that I could confide to her a
syllable about these new developments in the <i>affaire</i>
Richard Wynn.  No!  I didn't want to speak to her
about him or about Muriel!  I didn't want to confide
in her the quite staggering news that Harry Markham
had proposed to me in the garden; nor what I'd said
to him, nor why!
</p>

<p>
By the way, I am afraid every thought of poor
Harry and his perplexities had been swept clean out
of my mind by the much more staggering conversation
that had followed almost immediately upon his proposal,
on that never-to-be-forgotten Sunday afternoon; what
an extraordinary "Day of Rest" it had turned out!
</p>

<p>
But, as every Land-girl knows, the most paralysingly
interesting Day Off cannot stop the relentless
return of the Work-a-day Week.

CHAPTER XXXII
<br><br>
BUTTER-MAKING&mdash;WITH ACCOMPANIMENT
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "There grows a flower in our garden<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men call it Marygold,<br>
  And if you will not when you may<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall not when you wolde."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FOLK-SONG.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
On Monday I was churning again for dear life
as if I had no thoughts of a world beyond
that of the big, cool, whitewashed dairy with
its slate floor, its table set with pudding-dishes in which
fresh cream was standing, its tall, covered, red-and-black
crocks holding two gallons of sour cream for the
butter.
</p>

<p>
Helped by Mrs. Price, I tipped the sour cream into
the big brown barrel-shaped churn; I added the hot
water; I gave a few turns to the handle of the churn.
Then I took the bung out of the hole to let the air
escape, having been warned, the first day of my
churning, by an alarmed cry from the farmer's wife: "Let
the air out!  The air out!  Mercy!  The girl will
burst the churn for me.  Don't you know it's like you
have to hold a baby up when he's halfway through
feeding?  Don't you ever forget that again, my dear!"
</p>

<p>
I did not forget again; and now the whole process
was familiar to me of that homely miracle of butter-making.
</p>

<p>
Round and round went the handle&mdash;not violently
and spasmodically, as in my early days of setting about
any job, but rhythmically and steadily.  Oh, yes, I'd
learnt my lesson of letting "things do themselves";
never again would I imagine that violence meant
strength, any more than one need suppose that some
one speaking in a loud voice must be talking sense!  It
was Dick Holiday who had first taught me that, and
had taught the principles of handling anything, whether
it was spade or churn...
</p>

<p>
Round and round ... I glanced at the tiny glass
"window" of the churn.  No.  Not yet was it
crowded with any little yellow granules that announce
that the butter was "coming."  Today the butter was
obstinate.
</p>

<p>
Round, and <i>round</i> ... In my head, too, words that
had haunted me began to go round and round.
</p>

<p>
"Dick Holiday ... Richard Wynn ... Dick
Wynn ... Richard Holiday..."
</p>

<p>
I thought, "Am I to let Captain Holiday know I've
found out that he is Richard Wynn?"
</p>

<p>
My first answer to this question of my thoughts was
a vigorous "<i>Yes.</i>"
</p>

<p>
I decided, mentally, "Yes, I'll tell Captain Holiday
that I know all about it.  After all, he has been
pulling my leg ever since I met him!  All the time I've
been on this farm he has known that I am Joan
Matthews, the girl to whom he wrote that letter signed by
his other name!  And he's never allowed me to know
that he was the man who wrote the letter.  It will
make him look awfully foolish when I tax him with
it.  Serve him right!  I shall tell him, just to be able
to have the laugh over him for once!"
</p>

<p>
And I went on churning after another glance at
the little window; no sign of a crumb of butter on it
yet.  Patience!  Churn away....
</p>

<p>
The butter wasn't coming; but a fresh thought came.
</p>

<p>
This was a "No" as vigorous as my "Yes" had been.
</p>

<p>
"No!  I can't tell him," I mused.  "If I did it
would seem like reminding him that he did, under the
name of Richard Wynn, ask me to marry him.  It
would seem as if I were dropping hints that he might
try again.  Begging him, now that I knew him, to
ask me a second time.  Oh! horrible thought.  For it
isn't me he wants to marry now.  It must be since
the Spring that he's fallen in love with his cousin.  I'd
far better go on, pretending not to know that he's ever
been called anything but Holiday!"
</p>

<p>
Round and round ... Still no butter!  Mrs. Price
would say it was a sign that my sweetheart wasn't
pleased.  I, who had no sweetheart to please, must
work patiently still....
</p>

<p>
Another thought&mdash;.
</p>

<p>
&mdash;Will you forgive this chapter for being so much
about just my meditations?  There are times in one's
life when thought brings about changes as big as any
act could do.  One of these times came to me in that
spotless cool dairy, with me flushed and hatless, toiling
at that churn.
</p>

<p>
&mdash;It swung back to "Yes" again.
</p>

<p>
"I must tell him," I mused.  "I never answered his
letter.  How rude that must seem to him!  He said
not to write if he were not to come.  But a letter
demands a line just to say it's been received.  I must at
least explain to him why&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I checked myself, remembering.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I have explained to him already!  That
day we were feeding the chickens on the hillside!  I
told him the whole story of the letter I'd had from a
young man who reminded me of him!  Why, I can
hear Dick Holiday's voice as he barked at me 'Threw
the letter away?  You can't have thrown it
away!' ... To think that it was his letter!  Anyhow, he
heard then, without my knowing what I was explaining,
what became of his address!"
</p>

<p>
Here I changed hands without stopping the churn
in the way that I was taught by Mrs. Price.
</p>

<p>
I thought: "He knew everything, did he?  I've
a good mind to let him know that I know now as well!"
</p>

<p>
Then I thought again: "I would, if there weren't
any Muriel in the case.  Muriel stops it all..."
</p>

<p>
And then desperately I thought, still churning
busily: "Why does everything happen to me when it's
either too soon&mdash;or too late?  I fell in love with
Harry, but by the time he proposed to me it was too
late.  Dick wrote to ask me to marry him, but it was
too soon.  I hadn't seen what he was like now.  Ah,
if I'd known!  If I could have foreseen!  Wouldn't I
have written off by return of post to tell him he might
come and see me!"
</p>

<p>
I sighed.  "Too late.  He doesn't want to, now.
Ah, if he did!"
</p>

<p>
Then without warning or reason there flashed into
my mind the queerest thought of all.  "Supposing he
does want to?  Supposing all this about Muriel is
a mistake?  Supposing it's me he does care for all the
time?"
</p>

<p>
I said aloud, "What lunatic rubbish!" and bent
to look once more at the window of the churn.
</p>

<p>
Hurray!  A few precious golden granules were
forming on the glass.  The butter was coming at last.
Cheers!  Much encouraged, I went on making the big
churn spin round and round.
</p>

<p>
And as I did so, that lunatic theory spun in my
head.  Yes!  Suppose Dick Holiday-Wynn did care
for me.  Hadn't he sought me out, followed me, taken
the keenest interest in everything I did or said?
Hadn't he confided in me? ... Ah!  That story of
the girl to whom he'd proposed, and who had said
neither "Yes" nor "No" to him!  Why had I made
so sure that this had meant Muriel?  Supposing it had
been ... me?  Supposing this had been his way of
telling me?
</p>

<p>
Here a change in the sound of the milk in the churn,
dashed round and round, warned me that the butter
was "knocking."  I churned with a will, and with a
memory suddenly warming my heart.
</p>

<p>
That day of the thunderstorm in the hayfield, when
we had sheltered together under the elms!  Hadn't he
said "Dear" to me?  Had he meant it?
</p>

<p>
There was a possibility, a wonderful, dizzy, blissful
possibility that&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"How's that butter, Joan?" asked a bright voice
that brought me abruptly back from possibilities to
facts as Mrs. Price stepped quickly into the dairy and
up to the churn.  "Yes!  That's it, now, my
dear&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
For we had unscrewed the round lid and taken it
off the churn.
</p>

<p>
Yes; on the top of the butter-milk, with its rich and
poignant smell there floated what might have been the
golden ball cast by the Princess of the fairy-tale into
the fountain.  It was accomplished, that homely
miracle on which town-dwellers have been used to waste
never a thought.
</p>

<p>
England's butter!
</p>

<p>
For years English people took butter for granted.
Pre-war butter was just something that came out of
a shop and appeared as if automatically in silver dishes
with parsley about it.  They never inquired what
journeys it had made before ever it reached that shop;
whether from Wales, Ireland, Holland, or Denmark.
It was there; it happened.  ("Pass the butter,
please.")  Carelessly they spread it between hot toast
and strawberry jam; casually they left it in unwanted
pyramids at the sides of their plates.  In kitchens they
cast it in lumps into pans that concocted sauces; they
kneaded it by the fistful into rich cakes.  They
smarmed it on to the fur of petted cats so that the
creatures, licking it from their coats, need not stray.
Some of us can even remember laying "wobs" of it
(the size of a week's ration) on the school-room
linoleum and thus organizing slides for flying feet in
Blake-ily protected school-boots.  Only at nursery
tea-tables, perhaps, was the warning ever heeded "Now,
then!  Waste not, want not!"
</p>

<p>
We have paid for our extravagant waste of other
things besides butter....
</p>

<p>
And nowadays perhaps more interest is taken in
the process that produces such butter as is allowed
to us.  As carefully as one who grades yellow
amethysts I tipped up the churn, let the butter-milk run
out into the appointed crock, and washed, with cold
spring water, every granule of my precious butter off
the lid of the churn.  I collected it in a milk-white
wooden bowl with more water; I worked it with that
scoop which Mrs. Price called the "Llwy-y-menyn," a
spade-shaped thing, carved out of a single piece of
pear-wood and having a flat round handle with a
simple design for printing the pat.  The farmer's
wife told me it was more than a hundred years old;
how strange to think that more than a century ago&mdash;in
the year perhaps of Waterloo!&mdash;some clever hand
had cut and carved the tool which was to do its tiny
"bit" in the war for England's food!
</p>

<p>
I wielded it happily today, with that daringly happy
thought still warm at my heart.
</p>

<p>
"Salt, Joan," said Mrs. Price, handing me the
wooden box.  I added the salt; worked the butter
again, then put it aside in its corner.  I had to leave
it for a night to set.
</p>

<p>
And my thoughts were left, as it were, to set also.
</p>

<p>
For two days I heard and saw nothing of the Lodge
party.  By this time I had made up my mind how I
should behave to Captain Holiday, alias Richard
Wynn, next time that I saw him.  I should observe him
closely.  I should take my courage in both hands.  I
should say to him: "Captain Holiday, I want to
speak to you.  Do you know, I don't think it is quite
fair to make half-confidences to one's friends!  If you
confide in them about a given subject you ought to tell
them the whole of the story.  Not begin&mdash;and then
leave off midway.  For instance, you began weeks
ago to tell me the story of that girl who wouldn't say
whether she would marry you or not.  And you don't
tell me how that story is getting on!  You simply say
'Good-morning' and ask me questions about myself.
I should like to know about your affair, since you did
allow me to hear that there was one.  And now that
the girl is here in Careg&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Here I meant to break off.  Or rather, here I knew
that Captain Holiday would interrupt in his brusquest
tone.  He would be quite certain to say "The girl
here?  What d'you mean by that?"
</p>

<p>
I intended to answer: "Oh!  I'm so sorry if I
have said the wrong thing!  But I was quite certain
that you meant me to guess who 'THE' girl was!  I
thought it was the one who is staying with her mother
in your house now.  But if I've said anything I
oughtn't to have said, Mr. Wynn&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Here I'd intended to break off again.  I should
not need to emphasize the "Mr. Wynn."  I'd just
let it drop perfectly casually.  He would rise to it
all right!
</p>

<p>
He would say, or snap, or bark "How did you know
I had another name?"  And I could take it quite
lightly by saying "Oh, doesn't everybody know that?"
</p>

<p>
After which, I thought, it would be his turn to be
hopelessly puzzled.  He would wonder if I'd known
ever since I had been on the farm....  He'd ask
questions, he'd give himself away, he'd show me what he
meant!  That was what I wanted!  To know what
he did mean, whether it was about Muriel Elvey or me
or both of us.  And now I should find out and put an
end to all this hectic suspense.
</p>

<p>
I had got it all planned by the Wednesday of that
week.
</p>

<p>
But alas for all human plans!  Especially those
which have anything to do with what one is going to
say to young men.  I ask any girl who reads this
story to bear me out.  One never says what one
thought one was going to say so effectually.  These
brilliant conversational openings are not given.  These
happy retorts do not come off.  Nothing occurs that
one had hoped.
</p>

<p>
Only the unexpected happens; if that.  For what
did I hear, on the Thursday of that week, about
Captain Holiday?
</p>

<p>
Why, that I was not to see him at all.
</p>

<p>
He had left Careg.  He had gone away!

"OUR" GERMANS

<p class="poem2">
  "The Stranger within my gates,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may be evil or good,<br>
  But I cannot tell what powers control&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What reasons sway his mood;<br>
  Nor when the Gods of his far-off land<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May re-possess his blood."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;KIPLING.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Gone away!
</p>

<p>
The news was given to me by Elizabeth,
who had it from her <i>fianc√©</i>, Colonel Fielding.
</p>

<p>
His friend and host, Captain Holiday, had gone up
to London to attend a medical board; also he had
business which might keep him away for some time.
</p>

<p>
He'd be away for weeks!
</p>

<p>
A great blankness fell upon me, and when it lifted
I felt that I had been pushed rudely out of my fool's
paradise.
</p>

<p>
Care for me?  Of course, he couldn't care for me.
Men don't go away without a single word of good-bye
from girls of whom they care at all.  I had an
example of that in Harry.  He and Captain Holiday
cared for me about equally!  That is, not two straws!
</p>

<p>
I had been a lunatic to delude myself into the belief
that I was the girl of whom Dick Holiday had held
forth to me&mdash;"Just the girl I want!"
</p>

<p>
Not Joan Matthews!  No, no, Muriel Elvey was the
girl he'd meant all that time.  Yes!  I was now once
more miserably certain of that, in spite of all that
Colonel Fielding had said.
</p>

<p>
"Men," as Elizabeth declares, "are such poor
judges of what girl another man might want to
marry!"
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Mrs. Elvey and her daughter were still
ensconced at the Lodge, where they were to stay, it
seemed, until their host returned.  I heard all the
news about them, for "you know what gossips men
are," says Elizabeth, "men who pretend that we have
the monopoly of this fault!"
</p>

<p>
It was Colonel Fielding who hinted to Elizabeth&mdash;who
told me&mdash;that he fancied those ladies were glad
of a comfortable little country place whereat to stay
on the cheap now that they had let their London
maisonnette.  He had an idea that a good deal of
Mrs. Elvey's money had gone, lately, in one of the many
commercial enterprises that the war had brought down
and down.
</p>

<p>
Which was another reason why pretty Miss Muriel
would be glad enough to hook (if she could) a cousin
who was also a landed proprietor!  Obviously she
meant to stay on while there was the ghost of a chance
of her being asked to stay for good!
</p>

<p>
These comments were not mine, by the way, but
more of Elizabeth's <i>fianc√©'s</i> opinions.  Really that
young man had as broad a streak of what is called
"feminine cattishness" in his composition as any girl
that ever I met!
</p>

<p>
Still, for those weeks before the harvest, he was the
only channel for me to a world that held Dick Holiday.
It was through him that I heard that the medical board
had decided that Captain Holiday's nerves required
another six weeks' rest before he returned to light duty
again.
</p>

<p>
He remained away.
</p>

<p>
The only gleam of silver to this black cloud for
me was that he remained away, not only from me, but
from Muriel as well.
</p>

<p>
Wasn't this rather curious?
</p>

<p>
Then I decided that perhaps he was giving Muriel
time to make up her mind about him while he was away.
Perhaps he clung to that hoary-headed, white-whiskered,
mendacious old theory that "absence makes the
heart grow fonder."
</p>

<p>
By the time a heart is already involved it is too
"fond" to admit of any change!  So I found out to
my cost.  And if there is no heart in the case, as
Colonel Fielding declared, how can it "grow"
anything at all?
</p>

<p>
Muriel would remain whatever Muriel was.
</p>

<p>
I had a note from her one day, scented with her
special perfume, to ask me and Elizabeth to come up
to tea at the Lodge "as she found that we were able
to go out to tea on Sundays."
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth went.  I made a polite excuse and stayed
under the trees outside the hut with Vic.
</p>

<p>
The fact was I felt I just couldn't bear my first
sight of The Lodge, Dick Holiday's bachelor abode,
to be shown to me as a frame for the picture of Muriel,
sitting there in his easy chair, pouring out tea for his
friends out of his teapot, offering light cakes that his
old housekeeper had made, ringing his bell, behaving
altogether as if everything that was his were already
hers&mdash;himself included.
</p>

<p>
This would happen.  I felt it!  But I didn't&mdash;oh&mdash;I
didn't want to have it rubbed in before the
time!
</p>

<p>
So I stayed away and tried to cultivate a philosophical
attitude of mind.  A hundred years hence it would
all be the same, whether Dick Holiday had married his
pretty cousin, or whether I had taken the chance that
once was mine, and had written to say "Yes" to
Richard Wynn!
</p>

<p>
Further, it didn't matter to England (who must
be fed) whether one of her Land-girls was blissfully
happy or was unlucky in love.  But it did matter
that her harvest should prosper and should be brought
safely in.
</p>

<p>
This last question was one that weighed very heavily,
those days, on the mind of that gentle giant, our
employer, Mr. Price.
</p>

<p>
I used to meet him striding over the land on those
stilt-long legs of his, or leaning over gates and
contemplating the big stretches of gold that were the
cornfields, with his grey tweed cap pushed a little to
one side over a frown of thoughtful anxiety between
those ingenuous, intelligent blue eyes of his.
</p>

<p>
But that frown would always give place to a smile
for any of his workers that he encountered, and a
"Well, fine day again today.  Beautiful weather it
is, really!  Let us hope it keeps up for another ten
days, and then we shall do all right, if only&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Ah, that was the cause for anxiety!
</p>

<p>
"If only we had a few more to help with us, now,
to bring it in!"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Price, we'll all work," I assured him one
morning, "like two!"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, I know that.  You are doing splendidly,"
he said kindly.  "But you can't do more than flesh and
blood, after all!  And, dear me!"&mdash;he pushed the cap
yet further to one side&mdash;"when I think&mdash;&mdash;  Now, this
farm is only just under a thousand acres."  His blue
eyes swept the green-and-rusty-gold view of it.
</p>

<p>
"Sixty acres I used to have under corn," he went
on, "and now what have I got?  One hundred and
fifty!  I wouldn't have believed it if you'd told me in
'Fourteen.  And then I had all the men.  Even then
we considered we had a big enough job on at harvest
time.  But now&mdash;&mdash;  Who is there?  Myself and
Ivor and the soldier-substitute, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He went off murmuring to himself, shaking his
tweed-capped head in a worried way over the
problem that gave him more than three times the work
he had known before the war, but to be done by
one-fourth of the staffs that had been his in peace-time!
</p>

<p>
All over the country, as we knew, that problem
stared the farmers of 1918 in the face.
</p>

<p>
We Land Girls were doing our bit towards helping
to solve it.  Yes!  Elizabeth and Vic and I, with
all the other Vics and Dorises, the Aggies and Jeans,
and Gladyses, and Eileens of Britain.  But even so
there were not yet enough of us trained and able to
cope with the problem.  We were ready to give all
our time, and all our strength, and all our good-will.
</p>

<p>
But all the good-will in the world does not turn
a woman, however much else she can accomplish, into
a creature that can do a man's day's work in the
harvest-field.  Ask the farmers, who have nothing but
praise for their loyal Land Girls.
</p>

<p>
They will tell you, as Mr. Price would, that we have
been splendid, that we can milk, tend stock, clean out
sheds, drive the motor-tractors, carry out the jobs
of which there are never any end about the farm, and
take the places of the farm-boys now at the Front with
the utmost credit to our sex, but&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
But it still takes the strength of two of us to do
the work of one of them.
</p>

<p>
More workers, still more workers, needed on
England's harvest!  Every day the corn ripening that
should feed England; every day the boats going down
by means of which England was to be fed!
</p>

<p>
Do you wonder that my own private worries sank
into the background for a space?  I was surprised to
find that the thought of Dick Holiday could be kept
well at the back of my mind; and that I could even
stop myself from grieving fruitlessly over the
bitterness of the idea that he might have been mine, and
from sentimentalizing over my (very vague) memories
of him as a lad of nineteen at my home.
</p>

<p>
I was "seriously wounded" in the love-fight.  But
I could keep myself well in hand.  I reflected that now
I knew why men take their love disappointments in a
more balanced way (at least outwardly) than women
were wont to do.  Men have not only work, but more
interesting work with which to fill their baffled hearts.
As a result of our taking to these jobs, perhaps there
would now be fewer women in the world who would
allow themselves to be warped and blighted by
unhappy love affairs.
</p>

<p>
At least it was something to hope for! thought I,
turning from my own problem to that of the farmers.
</p>

<p>
The solution came&mdash;at all events to Mr. Price and
some of his friends in the neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
One smiling morning, as Elizabeth, Vic, and I
tramped to work along the lanes, the solution
overtook and passed us.
</p>

<p>
It took the form of a big dray drawn by two grey
horses and driven by a rather pale-faced young
sergeant in khaki with one empty sleeve; on this dray sat
comfortably a group of six or seven men not wounded at
all, apparently, wearing grey coats and dark trousers
patched with big ovals of scarlet and bright blue cloth.
On their heads they wore&mdash;all except one of them&mdash;small
round caps having red bands and a button in
the front.  They were blond, sunburnt, heavy-looking;
and they turned an inquiring stare upon us as
the dray went by.
</p>

<p>
With one voice Vic, Elizabeth and I exclaimed
involuntarily:
</p>

<p>
"Germans!"
</p>

<p>
German prisoners to work on the farms were the
answer to a problem serious enough.
</p>

<p>
But this answer brought other complications, as I
will tell you.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Of those German prisoners, four were to be
employed upon Mr. Price's farm.
</p>

<p>
One of the four was the man I had noticed as not
wearing the red-banded military cap, but a sailor's,
having the name of a German man-o'-war on the
ribbon.  All four, who came from the prison camp
outside "the town," were to be brought every morning
to work, and taken away every evening by the dray
that came to pick them up after it had called for their
comrades, who had been taken to work upon another
farm about a couple of miles away.
</p>

<p>
Sybil's employers had also taken one of them, and
some other people near had asked for one.
</p>

<p>
Shortly a new topic of conversation in the
neighbourhood was supplied by "our German prisoners."
</p>

<p>
"Good workers they are, that nobody can deny,"
was Mrs. Price's verdict.
</p>

<p>
Unanimous was the chorus of praise for the way
those fellows went at it, and the amount they'd get
done in a day; a lot more than our own chaps, by
George! (said some), and how quiet they were, and
conscientious, and well-behaved!  No trouble did they
give; none whatsoever!
</p>

<p>
"A Godsend to the farmers, they're going to be,"
pronounced Mr. Price at the dinner hour one day
when the corn was still in cutting.  The noise of the
motor-tractors filled the country as if with the hum
of a hundred giant locusts, while the sheaves fell in lines
behind the cutter-and-binder.  In one field the Germans
were setting up the sheaves in fives.
</p>

<p>
"What we should do without those boys presently
I don't know," declared Mr. Price from his end of
the table.  "I'm sure we ought all to be very
grateful to them!"
</p>

<p>
"What?  To them dirty Huns?"  This exclamation
burst from Vic as she sat heartily devouring
suet-pudding at my side.  "Grateful to them, Mr. Price?"
</p>

<p>
Indignation flushed the handsome, sunburnt, Cockney
face that she turned upon our employer.
</p>

<p>
Mildly his blue eyes met her scandalized dark ones.
</p>

<p>
"Why not, Vic?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Why!  I should think it's they who ought to be
jolly well grateful to us," retorted Vic warmly, "for
allowing 'em to be alive at all, once we got hold of
'em.  After all they done!
</p>

<p>
"Huh!" she continued.  "Why I can't pass the
gang of 'em working in the fields there without
thinking, 'Yes!  There you are, my lads!  It's cost us
Lord knows how many of the best to take you, and
there you are alive and jolly in the nice fresh air,
working just as you've a mind to, having everybody as
decent as pie to you.  It's a woman they ought to have
as Commandant, not a soft-hearted man!"
</p>

<p>
The gentle giant continued to look mildly across
the table at this indignant one.  I could see that he
could not understand her outburst on this subject.
Those four men in his field there&mdash;they were Huns,
yes, but captured Huns.  Fighting no longer against
us.  Working for us.  No longer enemies of ours.
They were helpless and in our hands, and we could
not be hard upon them!  This was how it appeared
to him.  And his whole, kindly, home-worshipping
Welsh heart spoke in his simple answer to Vic's tirade.
</p>

<p>
"Poor boys," he said.  "Far from their homes!"
</p>

<p>
I spoke up here.  "Plenty of our own boys are
as far from theirs."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," put in Elizabeth.  "And are they being
treated by the Germans one-half as decently as these
are being treated by us, do you suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Not likely!" with much feeling, from Vic.  I knew
she'd had a special "boy" who had been a prisoner
in Wittenberg during that relentless first winter of
the war.  He had died of it, Vic's young corporal of
the London Regiment.
</p>

<p>
Other women seem to have forgiven the enemy those
horrors of deliberate starvation, cold, dirt, and
disease, which destroyed their sons or sweethearts, but
not Vic Jelks, the Cockney Land Girl, whose motto is
"keep smiling" above the sorrow which was too proud
to wear any black.  Vic is one of England's woman-folk
who do not forget.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed some of these Germans seem quite as decent
as our own men," Mr. Price urged.  "Why, the other
day when I was away selling that horse, I was hearing
about some old farmer in Merionethshire who has a
German prisoner living in and working.  Now the
farmer's only son is a prisoner of war in Germany
working on a farm.
</p>

<p>
"Talking to the German one day about where his
home was, what do you think the farmer found out?
Why, that it was the father of his German that had
got his (the farmer's) son working for him!  And
what was the end of it?  The German prisoner wrote
home to his people.  'Be kind to your Welshman, for
these people here will do anything for me.'  So you
see, Miss Vic!"
</p>

<p>
But Vic would not let him have the last word.
</p>

<p>
"Did you say Merionethshire, Mr. Price?  Wasn't
it somewhere there that a big potato crop failed,
because the potatoes were put in by Germans?  The
blighters had cut all the eyes out of 'em so that they
shouldn't sprout.  How's that, eh?  That's the way
they'll do you in, after all their jaw about 'kindness'
and the lot.  That's the dirty trick they play you&mdash;if
you'll excuse my language, Mrs. Price!"
</p>

<p>
The farmer's wife, with her usual briskness, had
risen and had fetched two large bottles of milk, a
farmhouse loaf and a basin full of the butter that
I'd made yesterday.
</p>

<p>
"Now here's the lunch for these much-discussed
prisoners," Mrs. Price announced.  "You needn't
look as if you thought I were trading with the enemy,
any of you girls, because I'm not.  I'm sending the
men out something to eat because I know it makes
them work better if they're fed right.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not asking you girls to look at them, or speak
to them, or take them their food"&mdash;here she tucked
the lot into a big string bag used for carrying
vegetables&mdash;"in fact, I wouldn't allow it.  Mr. Price will
do all that.  Won't you, John?  Here you are, dear."
</p>

<p>
She handed him the bag of provisions and whisked
away like a busy little bird.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Price took the bag and set off across the
farmyard and out of the red-painted gate where Dick
Holiday had once lingered to talk to me.
</p>

<p>
I walked beside the farmer now, for Mrs. Price
had told me to bring in a cow and her calf, which
were to be found in the meadow beyond that cornfield
where the four Germans worked.  Crossing the road
we encountered a charming figure in summery attire,
carrying a big green sunshade.  Muriel Elvey!
</p>

<p>
She nodded patronizingly to me.  Upon Mr. Price
she smiled as sweetly as she did upon all men.  Curious
girl!
</p>

<p>
"What have you got there?" Muriel asked, tilting
the sunshade to one side and pointing a white-gloved
finger at the bag that the tall farmer was dangling.
"Bread and milk?  What, to feed the German prisoners?
What fun!  May I come and watch them
feeding, Mr. Price?  Like the animals at the Zoo sort of
thing.  Do let me; I'm so bored now my cousin is
away.  Nobody to talk to.  You can't count Colonel
Fielding exactly; he is such a milksop!" declared the
girl whom Colonel Fielding had so ruthlessly analysed;
she was obviously conscious of his opinion.  "That is,
I only like big men to talk to, that I can look up to!"
with an upward glance.  "Where are these Germans?
Ah, there!"
</p>

<p>
For we had come into the cornfield now, where the
captive Huns were taking their noontide rest.  In a
patch of shadow cast by the trees at the end of the
field they stretched themselves at ease.  One was lying
face downwards, his shirt-sleeved elbows in the
corn-stubble, and reading a letter.  One sat leaning against
the trunk of the tree, arms folded, cap over his eyes,
his ruddy, uncharacteristically dark face turned
towards us as we came up.
</p>

<p>
"He's quite good-looking for a Boche," pronounced
Muriel Elvey, with a critical glance, as though this
were some exhibition of strange animals&mdash;which, to
be sure, it was.  "But then, of course, some of them
that I used to dance with over there were handsome&mdash;the
officers, at all events.  These are all ordinary
soldiers, of course, aren't they?  One's a sailor, I see.
How amusing!  What were they all before the war,
Mr. Price?  Do you know?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't tell you, Miss Elvey," the gentle giant
answered this pretty chatterer.  "I'd like to know
myself what that dark one is&mdash;a farmer himself, I'm
sure, by the way he goes about his work.  But not
one of these understands a word of English, and there's
none of us on the farm that knows any German."
</p>

<p>
Now here my employer was mistaken.  I knew German
pretty well.
</p>

<p>
For two years after my people left the old home
in Wales I had been sent to the same finishing school
in Berlin as Muriel Elvey.  That was five or six years
ago now.  But I remembered, I believed I could have
spoken to these men in their own tongue.
</p>

<p>
Only&mdash;no, I couldn't have spoken to them.  I
should have hated to think of their being badly treated,
these Germans; starved or tortured as they tortured
and starved our British soldiers when wounded and
helpless in their hands.  That would have made me
unhappy, not so much for them as for ourselves to
think that we Britons could sink to such acts.
</p>

<p>
Personally, I didn't want to show any kindness to
these men.  Let them, now they were deprived of the
power to do any more mischief, be of as much use as
they could.
</p>

<p>
I didn't want to question them or look at them
either out of good-nature or curiosity.  A sudden
hard coldness fell upon me as I saw that big fellow
in the sailor's cap.
</p>

<p>
A German sailor!  What does that say?  I had
had one brother at sea, mine-sweeping&mdash;Jack&mdash;who
used to sing:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I'll sail with the scum of the lowest towns,<br>
  But not with such the Likes o' They!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
He had been shot as he put off in an open boat
from his wrecked ship.
</p>

<p>
No, I didn't want to speak German.  I didn't want
any German to get a word from the lips of an English
girl.
</p>

<p>
But Muriel Elvey cried with a laugh:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, call them up.  What fun!  I'll speak to them!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Price beckoned to the group of Huns.
</p>

<p>
They rose.  Two of them, the sailor and the dark
soldier whom Muriel had pronounced "quite good-looking
for a Boche," made as if to come nearer.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Mr. Price!  Let me give them their rations!"
Muriel begged prettily.  She put aside her
sunshade, took the bag of provisions from the farmer's
hand, and stepped forward.
</p>

<p>
The eyes of all four Germans were fastened eagerly
upon her; she was without a doubt the most alluring
sight that had met their gaze since last it had fallen
on a good, pre-war, "echt-Deutsch" meal of veal and
sour cabbage with damson sauce.
</p>

<p>
In fact, they looked at her rather as if she were
something to eat, this dainty English girl, "fresh as
milk and blood," as their own idiom has it, with her
summery hat shading her big eyes, and her frock one
of the usual bouquets of delaine she wore, in colour
white and yellow this time, and of a cut that gave
generous glimpses of the yellow gossamer silk
stockings above her suede shoes.
</p>

<p>
It was exactly the kind of look with which the Prussian
officers had been wont to ogle the school-procession
of us as we walked down Unter den Linden in the old
days on our way to classes.
</p>

<p>
I had heard that Germans have only two ways of
looking at a woman....
</p>

<p>
I felt I didn't like them to look at an English girl
like that!
</p>

<p>
Muriel seemed to have no such thought as these
Germans took their food from her hand and drew
nearer to her, smiling into her face and answering the
greeting she gave to them in their own tongue.
</p>

<p>
"You like working here on the land?" she asked
them in the careful German that we had acquired in
our Berliner pension.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, indeed, gracious young lady," returned the
rosy-faced, dark-eyed German soldier.  "It is much
better here in the country.  There is never anything
going on in a town!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I do not agree with you!" declared Muriel.
"I prefer the town myself.  The farmer here wants
to know what you were in civil life?"
</p>

<p>
The young German answered that he helped his
father, who had a big farming-estate in the Rhine
country.  This Muriel translated to Mr. Price, who
replied:
</p>

<p>
"I thought he knew all about the work.  He's a
nice young fellow, this.  Very kind.  Very pleasant
way with him.  Look how pleased he is to hear you
talk to him, Miss Elvey!  I hope he isn't longing too
much after his home, the poor fellow!"
</p>

<p>
And the Welsh farmer turned his kindliest smile
upon this son of German farming-folk.
</p>

<p>
I am bound to say it was difficult to connect that
dark-eyed, honest-faced young peasant with the
atrocities committed over Europe by his kind.  He
spoke and bore himself modestly and decently.  Every
line of his rather heavy, comely countenance
proclaimed him a truly harmless soul.
</p>

<p>
But it is when such thousands of these harmless
souls are moulded and driven by those fiends who have
cankered a once merely decent, sentimental, dreamy
nation&mdash;it is then that the atrocities are made
possible&mdash;the atrocities for which they all alike are
paying now&mdash;too lightly!
</p>

<p>
The other man to whom Muriel spoke in German
did not even appear harmless to me.
</p>

<p>
For the blue eyes of the German sailor, even while
they smiled ingratiatingly at the pretty visitor,
remained hard, watchful, and crafty.  From the first
instant I mistrusted that man!
</p>

<p>
He spoke with an accent that showed he was of
a class better educated than his companion.
</p>

<p>
"How excellently the gracious young lady speaks
German!  She lived, without doubt, for many years in
my country?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"I was at school in Berlin for two years," Muriel
told him, using as friendly a tone as if she were
speaking to one of our own naval men.  "Berlin was
delightful, I thought, before the war!  Charming!  As
long as I live I shall always remember the smell of the
Berlin 'Conditoreien'&mdash;such heavenly confectioners'
shops!  As you went by, you always got a whiff of
very good cigars mixed with the smell of boiling-hot
chocolate; delicious!"
</p>

<p>
She went on chattering, as she always did seem
able to chatter to men, freely and easily.  Whether
they were Huns or South Sea Islanders, as Mrs. Price
put it, men would be men to Muriel Elvey&mdash;that is,
the atoms which made up the atmosphere of admiration
that was her breath of life!
</p>

<p>
"Berlin and the Tiergarten and the All-darlingest
Opera!  How I did enjoy them all," Muriel gushed in
German.  "I did have a good time; at the houses of my
school-fellows where I was invited&mdash;everybody was so
charming and hospitable to me!"
</p>

<p>
"That is&mdash;yes&mdash;very understandable," put in the
Hun sailor, with a bolder glance.  "They who would
not be charming to such a charming young English
lady must indeed without taste be!"
</p>

<p>
Muriel, swinging her parasol, smiled graciously
upon this compliment&mdash;from a German!
</p>

<p>
Standing there in that Welsh cornfield, watching
this little interlude between that captured Hun and
that pretty English girl, I couldn't help remembering
the fate of other pretty girls, in countries less
fortunate than ours, laid waste by these men.
</p>

<p>
Rosy girls of Flanders, neat black-haired girls of
France, have been driven off into slavery and worse
under the rule of the Germans.
</p>

<p>
Germans would have done the same by the girls of
Great Britain!  Think of it.  Had their long-laid
plans succeeded for the invasion of this coveted
country of ours, our women&mdash;always made much of in
the old days by Germans!&mdash;our women would have
been part of "the loot of cities."  Men like these in
this very field would have treated Muriel Elvey, me,
all of us! no differently from the way in which they
treated the girls of Lille.  England's women!
</p>

<p>
They would never be able to do it now.  For that
we had our fighting men, our unsleeping Fleet, to thank.
</p>

<p>
And it seemed to me a kind of disloyalty to those
defenders of ours that Muriel should smile upon the
German sailor when he told her in that ingratiating
tone: "I regret that our countries are at war."
</p>

<p>
The retort rushed into my mind: "I hope you'll
all be made to regret it a lot worse before the end!"
</p>

<p>
But I did not speak.
</p>

<p>
Muriel said lightly and fluently: "I regret it, too!
War becomes such a bore, after so long!  Really, I
do not know what we began fighting for, and I don't
think that England wants to go on any more than
Germany&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Here I could not help putting in, indignantly, in
English: "Oh!  How can you say these things!  To
a German!  Oh, Muriel&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Before I said more, another voice called her
name&mdash;sharply, too.
</p>

<p>
"Muriel!"
</p>

<p>
It was the voice of Captain Holiday.
</p>

<p>
Standing engrossed in hearing Muriel's talk with
the prisoner, we had scarcely noticed the sound that
had broken into it&mdash;the wheels of the light dog-cart
that had driven up the lane behind the hedge.  In the
dog-cart sat Dick Holiday driving; his friend, Colonel
Fielding, was beside him.
</p>

<p>
He jumped down as Dick Holiday pulled up the horse.
</p>

<p>
"Good afternoon, Mr. Price," said Dick Holiday.
My heart jumped to see him as he saluted me; his
brown face, however, had never a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Muriel, get in," he said, "I'll drive you back to
the Lodge."
</p>

<p>
Colonel Fielding, with a more genial greeting to me,
held open the field gate for Miss Elvey.
</p>

<p>
But Muriel allowed them to wait for her.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, Cousin Dick," she called out airily from
the cornfield.  "What a way you have of popping in
and out like a harlequin at a pantomime, haven't you?
Mother and I thought we weren't going to see you for
another whole day.  How's London?"
</p>

<p>
"It still stands where it did," returned her cousin
drily.  He was evidently in no laughing mood.
"Get in by me, Muriel."
</p>

<p>
Muriel strolled through the gate.  "You don't seem
to have come back in very gay spirits," she said.
Then she turned to wave her little, white-gloved hand
to the sailor to whom she had been talking.
</p>

<p>
I saw Dick Holiday give her a very steady glance.
She laughed as she stood by the trap waiting before
she put her foot on the step.
</p>

<p>
"Don't look black at me," she said to him.  "I
know you did tell me I wasn't to speak to the Germans.
But I told you I would and I have.  So there, Master
Dick!" (Coquettishly.) "And these are very nice
Germans, too, as it happens.  I've had quite a chat
with that delightful sailor-man with the blue eyes.  I'm
sure he's nothing to do with the people who do the
dreadful things.  These Germans are different."
</p>

<p>
As he gave her his hand to help her up into the
trap I heard her cousin say, distinctly and steadily:
</p>

<p>
"I wish you would remember one thing.  No Germans
are 'different.'  All Germans are the same Germans
at bottom when you come to it!  All Germans
are&mdash;Germans!"
</p>

<p>
He took up the reins.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth's Falconer (jumping up behind as lightly
as any jockey) gave me a smile, an ineffable gesture
that was to spell "Pro-German, eh?  <i>She's</i> in for a
good strafing from old Dick; breakers ahead, cheerio!"
</p>

<p>
And off they drove.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Price and I, leaving the cornfield, went on to
that meadow where the cow and her calf were that had
to be brought up to the farm.
</p>

<p>
"Dear me, Captain Holiday was very hard about
letting Miss Elvey say a word to those boys,"
remarked the farmer to me as we walked along.  "There
is no harm in this lot of Germans.  No harm, I am
sure."
</p>

<p>
For the generous-hearted Welshman judges as he
would be judged himself.  Void of guile, he could not
see guile where it lurked.  He was like the best and
shrewdest of our own soldiers; clean fighters, they
were incredibly slow to believe what dirty fighters these
others were.  It has taken months and years of bitter
experience to show Britain that; Britain with her
obstinate dislike to believing anything really bad of the
nation with whom she fights!
</p>

<p>
Even now she does not believe they are as black as
they are painted!
</p>

<p>
Do we not hear that about us every day, and isn't
it the trait that our enemy builds on and takes
advantage of, to our own sorrow?
</p>

<p>
Now Mr. Price, of Holiday's Farm, Careg, was of
that lovable and broadminded type that believes the
best of all men, even Germans! until the very last
moment.
</p>

<p>
His moment of disillusionment about one particular
German was at hand.
</p>

<p>
As he himself said ruefully about the affair afterwards:
</p>

<p>
"Who'd have thought it?  I would not have
expected it of that man; I would not, indeed&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But let me tell you from the beginning what happened.

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
All this, you must remember, was in harvest time.
</p>

<p>
Harvest!  It spread like a golden smile over
the land on which we had been working all that summer.
All the country about our farm seemed to be tinted
in three broad colours&mdash;light green of the carried
hay-fields, dark green of the late summer woods,
blonde-yellow of the corn.  And I wish I could show
you who read a picture of the biggest cornfield at the
Prices' as it looked on a certain memorable day!
</p>

<p>
This field sloped steeply up to an elm-bordered
hedge, and in steeply-sloping rows the sheaves were
set up in fives; some still standing to catch every
warming ray of sun, others laid down flat, ready for the
forking.  This laying down of the sheaves was the
job given over to Vic, who had been here on the harvest
last year; to no mere 'prentice-hand would Mr. Price
allow it, for fear of waste.
</p>

<p>
She made rather a wonderful little picture, the Cockney
girl, dark and glowing against the sheaves, laying
one down after the other, steadily, carefully, now, so
as not to shake and scatter the grain that was to mean
England's bread.  The movement of Vic's brown arm,
lowering that sheaf, reminded me of the gesture with
which a woman "eases" her baby's sleeping head down
on to a pillow.
</p>

<p>
"How sweet Vic would have been with a little child,"
I thought.  "What a black shame that the man she
should have married was done to death in that German
prison camp!"
</p>

<p>
But Vic nodded gaily at me as I crossed the field,
drew the sleeve of her smock across her brown forehead
and called, "Getting on fine, aren't we?  This
is the way we're going to do in those dirty&mdash;&mdash;"  Here
she made a London street-boy's grimace towards the
big, red-painted cart that was coming round by the
barn towards the top of the field, driven by one of
the German prisoners.
</p>

<p>
That long cart, which started at the top of the
hill, took seven people to work it.  An odd seven it
was, too&mdash;a truly 1918 septette of workers!
</p>

<p>
Two Germans in the cart, one driving, one settling
the sheaves as they came.  Two British, the Welsh
shepherd Ivor, and the English wounded soldier
(substitute) with forks, loading&mdash;a strenuous job!
</p>

<p>
Two Land Girls&mdash;Elizabeth and myself&mdash;following
the cart with the long "heel-ropes" to catch up
any loose corn left lying in the stubble.  Last, but not
least, let me mention the seventh worker&mdash;a small but
intelligent-looking schoolboy of fourteen, who was
giving the last weeks of his holidays from Ellesmere School
to helping bring the harvest home.  This young Briton
walked at the heads of the two enormous horses, leading
them, starting them, or calling to them "Wobeck!"
in a voice three times as big as himself.
</p>

<p>
"Yes!  A mixed crew, isn't it?" I heard Mr. Price
remark to his wife as the pair of them came to
have a look at the workers on the carts before they
passed on to the barn.  "Welsh, English, Germans!
All perfectly friendly, too!  All of them with just one
object, to get in this big harvest as quick as it can be
done.  They will; you needn't be afraid!"
</p>

<p>
"If only that horse doesn't get his great hoof on
the little boy's foot, now," murmured Mrs. Price,
anxiously.  "That's all I'm afraid of!"
</p>

<p>
"Wo-beck!" thundered the infant at the horses' heads.
</p>

<p>
Again the cart stopped.  Up went the sheaves on
the fork, and into place on the piles of others in the
cart.  Then on again, while Elizabeth and I gathered
into drifts on our rakes the corn that had been left
over.  So, slowly down the row we went under the
hot August sun, and so through the gap into the field
where the roofed stack stood.
</p>

<p>
Two other Germans&mdash;one the sailor on whom
Muriel had smiled&mdash;were working on the stack.
Close by the empty cart was waiting to start at the
top of another row.  We set out behind it again; the
Welsh schoolboy, who had lingered to try to catch a
field-mouse that had bolted out of a sheaf, dashed back
to his post.  This time Ivor drove, the wounded soldier
packed the sheaves, and the Germans took the forks
and loaded, working with a concentration!
</p>

<p>
And so, the men changing jobs with each journey
we made, the warm and strenuous morning wore away.
</p>

<p>
After the midday meal there was another change;
Ivor the shepherd and the English soldier went off to
the barn, and their places on the cart were filled by
Colonel Fielding and Captain Holiday, who turned up
from the Lodge in flannels.  They worked as hard as
the Germans, who were their companions in toil, and
as silently.  After the first greeting, neither Elizabeth
nor I had a glance, nor expected one from her <i>fianc√©</i>
or his friend.  Fellow-workers we were.  Any social
matters were left out of it as long as we were on the
job together.
</p>

<p>
And yet&mdash;&mdash;  Even while my eyes were fixed upon
my rake and upon the stubble whence I meant to take
in every good ear of corn that I could gather up, my
foolish heart still sought to feed itself with glimpses
of the men who worked so near to me; "so near and
yet so far!" as Vic would probably have said with her
mock-sentimental glance.
</p>

<p>
How could Elizabeth still think that "all men were
so ugly" (all men except her own adored Female
Impersonator with his eyelashes and his girlish mouth)?
How could she not appreciate the grace of that other
man's light, yet masculine, build in action?
</p>

<p>
Farm-work did suit Dick Holiday, whom I preferred
to call in my heart Richard Wynn.  Seeming
never to look at him, I yet saw and delighted in every
movement of his.  What a wonderful gesture it was
of his when he pitched the heavy sheaf on to the
stacked-up cart, high above his head!  I loved him;
the play of his muscles, the rim of white that just
showed past the sunburn mark on his neck, the easy
set of his brown head upon his shoulders, to which his
shirt now clung!  More, I loved the clean, frank mind
that I could sense beyond the lithe, "out-of-doorish"
body; I loved his joy in the country, his pluck as a
soldier, his simplicity.  I liked him for being such
chums with that other, much more complex and artificial
young man of Elizabeth's.  I liked his honest
indignation over his lady-love's talking to the Germans.
I liked everything I'd ever heard him say, everything
I'd ever seen him do.  In fact, for me he could do
nothing wrong; nothing!
</p>

<p>
What a friend ... what a sweetheart ... what
everything that was attractive and sweet and sound at
the core...
</p>

<p>
And none of it was for me.
</p>

<p>
That could not alter the doom that I was his, as
completely as was the golden-and-white collie that lay
there in the field guarding his coat beside the hedge,
her nose between her paws and her eyes of love upon
her master.
</p>

<p>
Fate was settled for me.  Life without him meant
life without love and marriage&mdash;in these things I did
not wish for any second-best.  But he himself had
shown me other things in life.
</p>

<p>
The land!  I would stay on the land that had healed
me and made a woman of me.  It should remain my
interest and my delight to make a proper landswoman
of myself.  The land should be my sweetheart when
Dick (who might have been mine) was married to
another girl.
</p>

<p>
Held up, as it were, by this thought, I worked on
steadily through the afternoon.
</p>

<p>
At the break for tea I was so thirsty that I made my
way to the little drinking-fountain in the well behind
the barn.  Into a mossy stone bowl there fell a thread
of spring-water cold as ice and clear as diamonds.
A bright tin cup was always placed on a slab amidst
the ferns of the well.
</p>

<p>
But when I reached the place I found the German
sailor, who had been at the barn, with that cup to his
lips.  With a little flourish of politeness he put it
down, filled it again, rinsed it out, handed it to me.
</p>

<p>
"No, thank you," I said.
</p>

<p>
I turned and went back to the harvest-field.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards I was glad to think that I would not
drink after that German, not even from the crystal
Welsh spring.  I was glad that I had not had a
glance for that man who, treated with every kindness
by a too-confiding Briton, was at that moment
planning to do his worst by his benefactor.
</p>

<p>
That evening, when Elizabeth and I got into camp,
walking rather slowly after an arduous day, we found
the news there before us.
</p>

<p>
It had been brought in by little Peggy, the timber
girl.  On the road down from the woods, where they
were working, the timber gang had been passed by
Mr. Price's wagoner's boy, who was scorching into "the
town" by the shortest way, and as fast as an out-of-date
old bicycle could take him.
</p>

<p>
"Heard the news?" he had shrieked out to the
gang.  "Fire at Mr. Price's farm!"
</p>

<p>
Immediately the songs of the timber girls (who always,
on their return from work, made the welkin ring
with selections from Revue) had stopped upon a
staccato note.
</p>

<p>
"Fire?" they'd all shrilled together.  "Is it a bad
one?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I think!" the wagoner's son had retorted
with that enthusiastic glee over ill-tidings which marks
the small boy.  "All the barns is in a blaaaze!  Burn
up the harvest it will!"
</p>

<p>
He had whooped and sped on.
</p>

<p>
This was the story Peggy brought back.  Horrified
beyond words, Elizabeth and I stared at one another.
</p>

<p>
It must have happened only just after we had left
off work!  But what had happened?
</p>

<p>
"Let's go and see.  We must go back and see!"
I exclaimed to my chum.  "Perhaps we shall be able
to help.  Anyhow, let's get back to the farm at once!
Come along, quick!"
</p>

<p>
Together Elizabeth and I bolted like rabbits out
of the porch of the hut, leaving a chattering group
of girls to look after us.  Two or three of them broke
away to join us.  Peggy, with a large hunk of bread
and rhubarb jam in her hand, overtook us first.
</p>

<p>
"Now I bet you it's those Boches!" she cried as she
came up.  "Setting fire to the corn they've just got
in!  Well, I s'pose nobody <i>can</i> be astonished at <i>them</i>?
Come on, girls, let's see what it is they have
done&mdash;come on!  <i>At</i> the double&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
With a clatter of Land boots on the hard road we
took to our heels together and ran!

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
We ran, taking a short cut to the farm over
the stubble of the cornfield which had been
reaped that afternoon.
</p>

<p>
As we ran I kept saying to myself: "The big barn!
Can it be the big barn that's on fire?"
</p>

<p>
For that would have meant nearly all the wheat
of this whole big field destroyed and done for.
</p>

<p>
We ran, passing the gate beside which lay the dumpy
little gleaners' sheaves of every ear that the children
had found after our heel-rakes had combed out the
field.  Oh! would that represent all that was left of
this afternoon's harvesting?
</p>

<p>
The wind in our faces brought us a drift of smoke,
a smell of wood burning, the sound of shouting.
</p>

<p>
"Beat that down!" called Dick Holiday's voice.
"Never mind about that other.  Leave that shed!
It's done."
</p>

<p>
We came up, panting, to find the dear, familiar
farmyard in a pandemonium such as it had never
known before.  It was full of people, and the sound
of their feet and voices mingling with that deep,
ominous roar of the fire.
</p>

<p>
Something was fiercely ablaze.  Was&mdash;oh! was
it?  No, thank heaven, it was not the big barn after
all!
</p>

<p>
A harvest so good had overflowed the great tithe-barn
for which I had feared.  Part of today's wheat
had been stacked into a smaller shed, but a few feet
off from the great barn.  It was this shed that blazed
and blazed, sending up clouds of blue-grey smoke,
fountains of sparks, and that smell which was
something between that of an autumn bonfire and of malt
and bread.
</p>

<p>
Yes, it was England's bread that was being
destroyed there before our eyes.  But only a part of
that afternoon's harvesting of it.  For the other part
a fight was being put up; the big barn, perilously near,
must not be allowed to catch.
</p>

<p>
People had formed themselves into a chain to hand
down buckets full of water from the canal that
meandered by at the top-end of the farmyard to where
the fire went flashing up, licking up even to the
branches of the elms.  Dick Holiday in his shirtsleeves,
close to the taller figure of Mr. Price, was
dashing water, bucket after bucket of it, not on to
the flames at all, but on to the walls and woodwork of
the great barn.
</p>

<p>
"Sand," I heard him call.  "Sand in that pit over
there.  Mix it with the water!"
</p>

<p>
I scarcely know how it was that I found myself
with one of my best milking-pails full of wet sand,
racing down the yard beside Colonel Fielding.  All
together we were working presently, as we had worked
before in the field.  Even as I toiled strenuously with
my pails I noticed such odd little details in the midst
of the turmoil; I noticed the way Ivor and Colonel
Fielding turned their faces, as they threw the water,
away from the burning walls of the shed, now hot as
a furnace; I noticed Mrs. Price's little flying feet
under her grey overall; I noticed the frightened twitter
of the birds who had been scared out of their usual
roosting places in the hedge near by, and the angry
calling of the rooks whose nests were in those elms.  And
on Dick Holiday's forehead, under a hank of his short,
brown hair, I even noticed a great smudge of black
from the charred wood.
</p>

<p>
I was standing near enough to him to see this when
he, who had been looking up at the roof of the shed,
grasped my arm and pulled me back a step suddenly.
I thought he had not noticed who it was.  But he
exclaimed, "Joan, look out!  It's going to fall in
now."
</p>

<p>
And at the word the roof of that shed collapsed.
It fell in like a house of cards, or like (alas!) one
of the many French homes of which black ruin marks
the trace.  Up went a great spurt of flames,
crackling and roaring to the skies again.
</p>

<p>
Captain Holiday loosed my arm.  "The wind's
shifted," he said, in relief, watching the direction of
those flames.  Then, raising his voice, he added: "I
say, Mr. Price, the wind's turned again.  That'll be
all right now, I think."
</p>

<p>
"All right, Captain Holiday; thank goodness,"
came from the farmer, turning his heated, school-boy's
face with a look of relief also.  "The fire will blow
right away from the barn now.  Quite safe now.  Ah!
I didn't think we should stop it.  I thought it was
done for, indeed!  Leave it now, we can&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
For the flames, full fed, seemed to be sinking as
suddenly as they had leapt.
</p>

<p>
The labourers, land girls, a detachment of wounded
boys from the Hospital, and villagers drew back; faces
were mopped, sleeves rolled down again, hands placed
on hips, and deep ejaculations breathed out in Welsh
and English.
</p>

<p>
"Well, oh!" ... "I never saw such a thing."  "Saved
more than three-quarters of the corn, whatever! ... In
where did that fire start, Mr. Price?"
</p>

<p>
Then, quickly, a brusque voice rapped out curtly,
"What the deuce is this?  Mr. Price!  Come here,
will you?  Look at this&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"This" was something that Captain Holiday
seemed to have found just within the opening to the
big barn to which he had turned.  A group of us pressed
nearer to look.
</p>

<p>
"A very neatly arranged packet of shavings, by
Jove!" came from Dick Holiday, on his knees.  He
sniffed.  "Smelling of paraffin....  And here's
another of 'em, and another! ... Mr. Price, where is
the paraffin kept on this place?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll show you, Captain Holiday," said the farmer,
perturbed.
</p>

<p>
He turned towards the house, followed by the two
young officers from the Lodge, with the rest of us
bringing up a straggling procession in the rear.
</p>

<p>
At the back-door of the farm Mrs. Price had already
joined the one onlooker of this scene who had not
ventured down into the yard&mdash;an elegant onlooker,
in a semi-evening toilette of mauve georgette, half-hidden
beneath a creamy wrap.
</p>

<p>
Muriel, excited and amused, hardly seemed to realize
the gravity of what she had been watching.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Dick, have you got the fire out, nearly?"
she chattered.  "I should have come down to see you
all near to, only I didn't want to ruin these shoes.
I'd just dashed out as I was!  Thrilling, isn't it?
What is this about paraffin?" she added, quickly.
"Did they say you found paraffin thrown about?  Oh!
I wonder"&mdash;more excitedly&mdash;"I wonder if it was
that man I saw with the can?"
</p>

<p>
Sharply her cousin rapped out, "What man?'
</p>

<p>
"That nice-looking sailor with the blue eyes who
said I spoke German so well&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Dick Holiday gave a very quick movement.  "The
German?  You saw him with a can of paraffin?
What's this, Muriel?  When?"
</p>

<p>
"Today&mdash;at lunch-time, I think it was," returned
Muriel, while we all listened eagerly.  "I was coming
back from taking a letter to the post-box, and I met
that German I was talking to the other day, close to
the little well in the field&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's all; he just had a tin of paraffin
showing out of his jacket pocket, and I asked him, in
German, what he was going to do with it."
</p>

<p>
"What did he say?" asked Dick Holiday, more
than curtly.
</p>

<p>
"He said he was going to put a little paraffin in
the ditches to destroy the mosquitoes' nests there are
hereabouts," explained Muriel.  "He said the farmer
had ordered him to do it."
</p>

<p>
"Did you give him that order, Mr. Price?"
</p>

<p>
"Never in my life!" returned the farmer.
</p>

<p>
"Do they know where your paraffin barrel is in
that shed?  Would they be able to get to it; should
you notice them if they were round about it,
Mrs. Price?  Have you noticed any of them there?"
</p>

<p>
"Really, Captain Holiday, I couldn't say," returned
the farmer's wife, with concern.  "I've got so
used to them, I haven't thought very much about
them&mdash;-"
</p>

<p>
"Ah! the fault of all of us!" declared Dick Holiday,
with a sternness I had not before heard in his
voice.  "There's very little doubt in my mind what
to think about them now!"  He turned to the farmer
again.  "Don't let any of your men touch those heaps
of shavings, Mr. Price, please.  Leave everything just
as it is, will you?  The evidence will have to be looked
to.  No telephone on the farm, have you?  I shall
have to send over to the camp, then.  I say, Fielding&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth's "Falconer," his golden hair rumpled and
his delicate face very flushed turned, from where he
was having a murmured talk with the Man-hater.
</p>

<p>
"Sorry to trouble you, but I'd like you to drive
over in the dog-cart to the prison camp," said Dick
Holiday.  "I'll stay here till the commandant comes.
My compliments to him (he's a Major Russell), and I'd
be obliged if he'd let you bring him back here at once."
</p>

<p>
"Right," said Colonel Fielding, and was off.
</p>

<p>
In a worried murmur Mr. Price was saying: "Well,
indeed, I wouldn't have believed it of our Germans!
That sailor, you can't deny that he seemed a pleasant
young fellow!"
</p>

<p>
"Can't deny the paraffin-smell on his jacket, if it
was he," retorted Dick Holiday, with a resigned shrug
of his flannelled shoulders.  Then he turned to Muriel.
I suppose it wasn't in masculine human nature to
resist saying what he did to her.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you'll believe me now when I say a German
is&mdash;always a German?  You see why I told you
you weren't to speak to 'em?"
</p>

<p>
A sudden change came over Muriel's face.  I suppose
there isn't a girl alive who likes being shown, before a
little crowd of people, that she is in the wrong.  Muriel,
I remembered from our Berlin days, hated it more than
most people.  By chance I caught her eye as her cousin spoke.
</p>

<p>
That tiny thing seemed like a lighted match in corn
stalks as dry as those which had just been blazing.
</p>

<p>
For now Muriel blazed up.  Temper flashed from
the big eyes she turned upon her cousin.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think I'm letting you 'tell' me what I am
or am not to do, Dick, thank you," she informed him
with a high-pitched little laugh.  "I don't take that,
even from&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Here she looked straight at me for a change.
</p>

<p>
"I don't take orders, even from the man I am
going to marry.  And, by the way, I don't think you
have heard the news yet.  I am engaged to be married,
you know."
</p>

<p>
She paused for a moment, lifted her neat little head,
still looking hard at me.  In her pretty eyes I saw,
with surprise, the expression of the woman who wants
to scratch somebody; wants to hurt.
</p>

<p>
She announced, "I am writing today to promise to
marry Captain Markham!"
</p>

CHAPTER XXXVI
<br><br>
THE HARVEST-MOON
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Oh, moon of my delight!"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;OMAR KHAYYAM.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
About Muriel's piece of news a good deal was
said, later on, by Colonel Fielding.
</p>

<p>
He declared that Miss Muriel, who had
played all she knew to marry the Holiday property,
now saw that the game was absolutely up, and that she
had better fall back at once upon the other ... er
... source of comfort and luxury.  He, Colonel
Fielding, vowed that her intention to write to "that
unfortunate blighter, Markham," was born then and there
on the steps of the farmhouse as her cousin strafed her.
He also told Elizabeth that Miss Muriel's last hope
was to irritate Miss Matthews, whom she had always
suspected of a <i>tendresse</i> for young Markham.
</p>

<p>
To all this the Man-hater replied that if the
"Falconer" made any more of his catty remarks about the
future Mrs. Markham, it would merely show him up
as a disappointed admirer of hers.  I believe they
"chipped" each other happily for hours about this.
</p>

<p>
But to return to the actual moment of Muriel's
staggering announcement.
</p>

<p>
She looked round for its effect.  Certainly she got
it.
</p>

<p>
All eyes gazed upon the pretty creature standing
there.  Engaged!  Another engagement in the place!
This excitement eclipsed all thought of the fire, the
incendiary Germans, the commandant (who couldn't
come, by the way, until next day).  For an instant
we stared; and Muriel's cousin seemed the most
dumfounded.
</p>

<p>
But he pulled himself together the first.  Holding
out his hand, he exclaimed heartily: "Good!  The best
of luck, my child!"  He wrung her small fingers,
beaming all over his face.
</p>

<p>
Then I heard myself exclaim: "Oh, Muriel!  You
really are going to marry Harry?  I am so glad; so
glad!"
</p>

<p>
(Which I certainly was!)
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth and the others added congratulations.
Vic declared there never was such a spot for "getting
off" as here!  Mr. Price beamed as benignantly as if
Muriel were a favourite sister, and little Mrs. Price,
all smiles, insisted on our drinking Miss Elvey's health
in her own elderberry wine, in the dining-room.
</p>

<p>
"Come in, all of you!" she urged hospitably.
"Come, Captain Holiday&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But Captain Holiday stood still, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Price, I'll join you in one second, but
Mr. Price has got his coat, and I really can't come in
like this in shirt-sleeves.  I must get a coat; I've lost
mine."
</p>

<p>
"Lost it?" exclaimed the farmer.  "Dear me, where
did you do that, Captain Holiday?"
</p>

<p>
Captain Holiday answered promptly and serenely.
"Miss Matthews thinks she passed a coat in the harvest
field as she was coming along" (and there was a
"Dare-to-contradict-me" gleam in the eyes he turned
to me).  "You might just come along with me, Joan,
and show me where you saw it?"
</p>

<p>
Gasping over this bit of obvious improvisation, I
found it had succeeded.
</p>

<p>
Muriel and the others had disappeared into the
house, and the shirt-sleeved Captain Holiday was
piloting me gently but firmly across the now-deserted
farmyard.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Holiday," I protested, "I never said I
saw a coat&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He interrupted serenely.  "Of course I rapped out
just any excuse to get you to myself at once.  I've
things to say to you.  But you know that, Joan."
</p>

<p>
Yes ...  Already I guessed (and with what sudden
rapture!) what was coming.  Not always do misunderstandings
"keep up" until the uttermost word is said.
For long enough I had misunderstood.  But now&mdash;&mdash;  I
knew, from the tone in which he wished Muriel joy,
that she never could have been "the" girl.  That had
not been cordiality "put on."  He had been as
genuinely glad as I was to hear of the girl's engagement!
</p>

<p>
And I knew what was coming next; with quiet but
growing delight I expected it, yet did not wish one
word of explanation to be hurried.
</p>

<p>
He began, in his direct way: "What do you think
of this news about my cousin and Captain Markham?
Are you surprised?"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know whether she meant to accept him.
But I knew he was desperate about her!  He told
me so himself, that Sunday we all went to tea with
those people."
</p>

<p>
Here Dick Holiday gave me a quick, searching
glance.  We were going through the gate of the
harvest-field as he took up "That Sunday!  Yes!  D'you
mind my asking you?  Markham was telling you
about all that, in the garden?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
Dick Holiday said simply, "I thought he was making
love to you."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!"  A light had broken upon me.  Just as
keenly and as mistakenly as I had been jealous of
Muriel, this man at my side had been jealous of Harry.
So he had gone away, avoided me these last weeks!
</p>

<p>
He said: "Markham is a great pal of yours, is he?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I agreed.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing more?"
</p>

<p>
I said: "I think you guessed that he was the man
I cared about once."
</p>

<p>
"Once?" he repeated eagerly.  "Why not now?"  He
knew as well as I did!  Sure of it, I laughed
softly as I glanced about the cleared field.  I said,
"I don't see that coat of yours anywhere about."
</p>

<p>
"Must be in the next field," he returned, coolly.
We walked on, over the stubble and through a gap in
the hedge to where the sheaves still stood in their
pyramids of five.
</p>

<p>
Then pausing again, he added.  "What about my
question, though?"
</p>

<p>
My heart was beating very quickly under that
well-worn smock of mine, but I managed to say, "Which
question was that?  You always ask so many, Captain
Holiday."
</p>

<p>
"I've told you so often not to call me that," he
retorted.  He paused, standing tall and dark and
graceful between the mauve evening sky and the russet
stocks.  "My name," he began&mdash;and I expected to
hear the familiar protest&mdash;"my name is Dick, you
know."  But he ended with an announcement which I
suppose was meant to take away my breath.
</p>

<p>
"My name was Richard Wynn."
</p>

<p>
I could trump that, I thought!
</p>

<p>
Looking up at him, I said, "I knew."  But this
he trumped instead by saying calmly: "I wondered
how soon you would!  Extraordinary that you didn't
tumble to it before, Joan, when everybody here knew
I'd only taken my uncle's name.  The Prices, Muriel,
any of the farm people could have told you.  Or
Fielding&mdash;I suppose, by the way, he did tell you?  Yes?
So now you know I did write to you, in the spring&mdash;letter
you threw away, eh?  What have you to say
about it?"
</p>

<p>
He took a step nearer to me.  I stood my ground,
and retorted, "Richard Wynn, why did you write
that letter, to begin with?"
</p>

<p>
"Difficult to explain," he said simply, pulling an
ear of corn from the stook nearest to him and nibbling
at it as if absently with his strong teeth.  "Difficult
... Well!  It was when I was feeling pretty rocky
and 'down'&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Elizabeth always said it was the effect of
shell-shock!"
</p>

<p>
"Did she?" He laughed, nibbling that ear.  "It
wasn't altogether, either.  I was in hospital, badly
hipped.  Some of the fellows there were engaged; nice
girls coming to visit them, bringing them roses.
They'd something to look forward to every afternoon.
Bucked to the nines.  'My girl'&mdash;'my girl says this'&mdash;'my
girl and I are doing a show today'&mdash;'my girl's
brought me so-and-so'&mdash;'my <i>fianc√©e</i> and her governor
took me so-and-so'&mdash;&mdash;  That sort of thing the whole
time.  Here was I"&mdash;he threw away the stripped
stalk&mdash;"back in Blighty and scarcely a soul interested
whether I lived or died.  Not a woman in my life at all,
Joan....  All this sounds awful piffle, perhaps, but
that's not a funny thought for any fellow when he's
down; not a woman to care&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
His brusque voice sounded boyishly shy.  It tore at
my heartstrings; but I only said the first thing that
came into my head.
</p>

<p>
"What about the Elveys?  What about your aunt
and Muriel?  They must have known you were in
England, wounded."
</p>

<p>
"Er&mdash;&mdash;"  He paused.  "Yes.  Yes, I suppose
they did.  But they only wrote much later on, just
before I came down here ... Well, then I got to barracks,
Millshott.  It was still there ... I mean that
feeling of being fed because I'd no one to care.  One
night&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He stopped.  "Ah!  Have I got to report all these
details?"
</p>

<p>
"Please.  Yes.  You must."
</p>

<p>
"One night I saw a fellow in the card-room, writing.
You could tell by his face it wasn't any business-letter.
I felt 'Gad,' if I'd a girl to write to of my own!'"
</p>

<p>
"I should have thought&mdash;-" I hesitated.  "I
shouldn't have thought it was possible ... for you
... not to have had one..."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Now what d'you mean by that?"
</p>

<p>
"Go on.  After you thought 'Gad, if I'd a girl to
write to'&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, sort of desperately, I fished out an old
letter-case of mine that I hadn't touched," he told me,
"for years.  I found&mdash;what d'you think?&mdash;a bow of
blue ribbon.  Blest if I hadn't forgotten what it was, at
first&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Flattering of you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
&mdash;"but I soon remembered, Joan!  I'd sneaked it
off your plait.  D'you remember?"
</p>

<p>
"Go on, please."
</p>

<p>
"Well, <i>I</i> began remembering the old days at
Mr. Matthews's farm....  The veranda with all our sticks
and fishing-boots!  The wood-fires.  The icicles round
the back-kitchen door; you remember?  That fox-terrier
pup I gave you&mdash;he's dead, I expect?  And how
I used to go out after the beagles with your brothers&mdash;what
a regiment of chaps we were!  And you just the
one little girl ... I remembered how I'd looked at
you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you couldn't have looked at me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't I?  I'd often thought 'There's a sweetheart,
now, some day, for some man.'  I remembered,
in barracks.  Then I thought 'She's grown-up now,
that kid.  Supposing there were a chance of that very
girl, grown-up, looking at <i>me</i>?'  So&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He stopped, with a smile, as though I must understand
everything now.
</p>

<p>
To me an odd thing had happened; just as on that
day among the chickens on the hillside I was swept
back for a moment to the Past.  I felt memories
flocking and twittering about me.  I remembered him,
the leggy dark Welsh lad ... Mr. Wynn, the pupil
... yes ... yes, this was his familiar voice; this
was the look and the movement of him, it was all
coming back to me ... and the time that he'd said
"Good-bye" to me under the dripping veranda.  One
hand clutching his suit-case, the other grasping me
suddenly by the hair, his boy's mouth had snatched a
half-brotherly kiss; the first I'd known from one who
was not a brother.  And now, more than seven years
later, he came close, put his hand on the nape of my
neck, just under my twisted-up hair.  It thrilled me to
the heels with happiness.
</p>

<p>
"Wait.  Wait," I whispered, pulling back.  "I
haven't heard everything yet."
</p>

<p>
"You have."
</p>

<p>
"You always did&mdash;did contradict me," I said,
standing there under his hand.  "And you only wrote
to me because there was nobody else&mdash;not much of a
compliment&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What?  Well, no answer came, and I knew I'd been
an ass.  Then came the business about my uncle's
property."  He began talking very quickly.  "That
shoved things right to the back of my mind, Dear
... why d'you shiver?  Are you cold?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"No?"  He put his other brown hand about my
neck.  "Shoved things out of my mind until I came
right up against you, Joan.  You!"
</p>

<p>
"At the Camp&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No fear!  Hadn't I spotted you all in your brand-new
uniform, bless you, on Euston platform that morning?
That was why I got little Rhys to bring me up to
the Camp at once, to make sure it was you.  You see,
I'd remembered what you looked like, even if you had
forgotten me."
</p>

<p>
I thought "Forget him!  How, how could I have
thought of anything but him&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"So that's all," he said.  "Only&mdash;that wasn't
really much of a kiss just before I went to Canada&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But you haven't told me about all these weeks
here, since then!"
</p>

<p>
"That'll keep to make conversation (if we're short
of it) after we're married!" he declared abruptly.
"You see as we shall get married practically at
once&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'As we shall!'  Are you not going to ask me
what I have to say in the mat&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, because you always complain so of my asking
questions," he whispered.  He was near enough to
whisper now, having drawn me close, close to him.
"Put your arms round my neck," he coaxed.  "Kiss
me."  He put down his brown face.
</p>

<p>
"There's&mdash;Oh, there's such a smudge of black from
the wood-smoke on you, Dick!"
</p>

<p>
"D'you mind, sweetheart?"
</p>

<p>
Over his shoulder I saw a strip of evening sky
deepening slowly from mauve to violet.  The long-drawn,
quavering cry of an owl came across to us on the freshening
air.  And from behind a black fringe of elms there
peeped out (fit witness to a Land-Girl's betrothal!) the
big round primrose-colored Harvest-Moon.
</p>

<p>
Oh, night of Harvest in that rich Welsh valley!  To
some you meant the end of toil, relief from anxiety,
triumph; to some the overthrow of darkling schemes.
To me you were Love's dream come true; oh, night of
stars and murmurs and caress, oh not-to-be-forgotten
night ...
</p>

<p>
I found no words to voice what was in my heart,
beating so near to his own.
</p>

<p>
"Dick, Dick!" I sighed.
</p>

<p>
He nestled his face (smudge and all) against mine,
in a string of kisses that were just a give-and-take of
the delight that is beyond all words.

THE VICTORY-DANCE
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Now joy, Old England, raise!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the tidings of thy might,<br>
  By the festal cities' blaze<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the wine-cup shines in light!<br>
  And yet, amidst that joy and uproar,<br>
  Let us think of them that sleep<br>
  Full many a fathom deep<br>

<p>
Lights, lights over London again!
</p>

<p>
After four years of darkness and gloom the
dear old lights shone down on the streets where
one could see people's faces plainly once again&mdash;and
what a crowd of faces, too!  The pinky speckle
of them was like nothing as much as a huge flower-bed
of that sturdy plant London Pride.  And above them
there had burst into bloom the sudden crop of fluttering
flags ... the flags of Victory.  Yes, at last after
these four tense years Victory had set those flags
waving and those lights blazing and those people cheering
and shouting and dancing in the streets of London town.
</p>

<p>
Were you there?
</p>

<p>
Were you one atom in that whirling stream of laughing
and rejoicing people that surged and circled and
broke and re-formed again about the steps of the
Pavilion and the fountain in Piccadilly Circus?  Did
you fly before those organized rushes of the
Australians through the <i>m√™l√©e</i>? did you ride on
motor-drays driven by R.A.F. cadets who had adorned
themselves with nurses' bonnets and cloaks? did you laugh
helplessly over the antics of those young and uplifted
Naval officers who, correctly uniformed but for their
smashed-in bowler hats, were pressing coin and tobacco
and vows of eternal friendship upon their taxi-driver
while the surrounding group applauded wildly?
School-boyish&mdash;yes, the Forces were a crowd of schoolboys
let loose that night, and hadn't they deserved it,
the right to make holiday and to rejoice in England's
way, which is behind a laughing mask and a tin trumpet?
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
And behind that again; ah, what?
</p>

<p>
Not all the cheers and merry nonsense talked could
drown the undersong of Victory-week.
</p>

<p>
Boys who fell to buy that Victory, day after day of
that four years' struggle!  Boys who sold their budding
lives, this one working his gun, that one on his
ship, that other darling in his downward crashing
'plane!  Sons, brothers, lovers, sweet young cousins
and boy-friends of ours!  All day the thought of these
had burned with a proud and steady flame at every
British woman's heart.  All day there had been on our
lips the names, the familiar home-names, of those who
would not come home ... "If He&mdash;if They were
only here ..."
</p>

<p>
Hard to believe that they were not!  Far, far beyond
that hubbub one seemed to catch echoes of dear
exultant voices we shall hear no more with these our
earthly ears, calling "<i>cheerio! ... I say! ... Can't
you hear? it's</i> US!  <i>So long!</i>"  And, beyond the
thronging faces under the blaze of the street-lamps,
Memory and Love could raise a cloud of other faces:
laughing, care-free faces of youths for whom there
would be no Tomorrow of difficulties and sordid
struggles and the anti-climax of growing old.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"Yes!  Thank Heaven that Jack and the rest of
them will never have lived to <i>that</i>&mdash;&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
"That" was a sight of which I got a glimpse as a
taxi steered its way inch by inch from the dense throng
about the entrance to the Berkeley.  I spoke aloud in
the crowd where I found myself, arms linked with my
Dick on one side of me and with Elizabeth's young
husband on the other.  The happy four of us (two men in
war-worn khaki, two girls in breeches and new smocks)
had come up to town together on the Wednesday after
that glorious Monday.
</p>

<p>
And the sight which had struck me was that of the
face over the heavy fur collar of the man who was
sitting in that taxi; bloated and coarse, he carried his
sixty years as though he had not in all that time known
one hour of strenuous exercise or of clean joy in the
open.  Over-eating (more disgustful in its effects than
heavy drinking) was stamped on his face from the bags
beneath his eyes to his lowest chin.  A dead thing he
seemed to me; dead more truly than any of the lads
who had flung their happy lives away for the cause
of the world while he and his like "lived."  Through
the square of the window I caught above his shoulder
a glimpse of a girl's pretty and pettish profile...
</p>

<p>
The crowd surged in between us and the taxi before
I could exclaim "<i>Muriel!</i> ... I say, it was Muriel;
did you see her?"
</p>

<p>
My tall young husband turned his head as it towered
above us.  "No!  Muriel with him?  I thought I saw
old What's-his-name; I s'pose he's taken her out to
celebrate on his steel-profits&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
For since Harvest-time Muriel Elvey had been twice
engaged; for a month to Harry, an engagement quickly
broken after she and her mother had been to stay at
the house of this distant connection, the elderly profiteer
of whom I had caught that glimpse.  She was to marry
him.  Elizabeth and I thought it the most horrible
thing we had ever heard of.  But Dick had only
shrugged his shoulders and Colonel Fielding had
declared it was an excellent arrangement and that the
... er ... Mystery-Girl would consider she was
in for a very good time.
</p>

<p>
"A good time!"  Oh, misused phrase!  To me it
has come to represent one image; the memory of a
fleshy and stubby-fingered male hand resting on a
taxi-door, holding a fat black cigar and wearing a diamond
that spat out coloured lights, less sparkling than the
dewdrops that stud the Welsh bracken at home.
</p>

<p>
We were all going home again in a couple of days;
the Land was home to us for ever now; a very little of
Town would do for all of us these days, and we, fit and
joyous from air and work and elemental interests, had
a "good tune" which we never even called such.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it odd," I remarked as we struggled back
towards the Circus again, "that Harry Markham <i>didn't</i>
seem to mind about Muriel so much, after all?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Elizabeth's Colonel, succinctly.  "He
had a month of her.  I bet he's ... er ... jolly
glad of the change to that topping little Driver-girl he's
all over the place with now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"'<i>Go</i> it, Mother Browne!'" whooped the youngest
of the dancing warriors, a Captain with three wound-stripes
and a cheeky peach face which no German bullet
would ever now spoil.  "Come on!"
</p>

<p>
"Here, what's this, what's this&mdash;&mdash;" broke in my
Dick.  "What are you doing, you people&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"This" was a new swirl of the whirlpool which had
sucked us in just at the top of the Hay market.  A
score of young men in khaki and leather kit, British,
Overseas men and a huge American, were dancing round
a policeman, good-humored monument of Tolerance.
</p>

<p>
They opened the ring, crying "Land-girls!  Land
Army!  Put the girls in too; come on, dance round the
girls&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth and I, laughing, were borne into the middle
of that circle; our men joined hands and whirled around
us with the others.
</p>

<p>
"Dance, man, dance!  Dance, Bobby; haven't you
heard the news?  There's a Peace on ... No!  You
can't have my stick&mdash;some girl's snatched my perfectly
good stick!  <i>My</i> perfectly good stick that I've had
ever since the War! ... The War's over!  Come on,
dance round the pretty Land-girls! they helped to win
it, too!"
</p>

<p>
We laughed, my chum and I, but in our eyes tears
danced with smiles, and in our hearts a thrill of pride
was all astir as we murmured to each other, "Did you
hear that?  It is true, isn't it?  We did do our little
bit to help!"
